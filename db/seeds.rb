  {name: "Roger Ebert", publication: "Chicago Sun-Times", bio: "Roger Joseph Ebert (June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.\r\n\r\nEbert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews, followed by several variously named At the Movies programs. The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase \"Two Thumbs Up,\" used when both hosts gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper.\r\n\r\nNeil Steinberg of the Chicago Sun-Times said Ebert \"was without question the nation's most prominent and influential film critic\", Tom Van Riper of Forbes described him as \"the most powerful pundit in America\", and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called him \"the best-known film critic in America\".\r\n\r\nEbert lived with cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands from 2002. This required treatments necessitating the removal of his lower jaw, which cost him the ability to speak or eat normally. His ability to write remained unimpaired, however, and he continued to publish frequently both online and in print until his death on April 4, 2013."},

  {title: "Armageddon", content: "Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. \"Armageddon\" is cut together like its own highlights. Take almost any 30 seconds at random, and you'd have a TV ad. The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained. No matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out.\r\n\r\nThe plot covers many of the same bases as the recent \"Deep Impact,\" which, compared with \"Armageddon,\" belongs on the American Film Institute list. The movie tells a similar story at fast-forward speed, with Bruce Willis as an oil driller who is recruited to lead two teams on an emergency shuttle mission to an asteroid \"the size of Texas,\" which is about to crash into Earth and obliterate all life--\"even viruses!\" Their job: Drill an 800-foot hole and stuff a bomb into it, to blow up the asteroid before it kills us.\r\n\r\nOK, say you do succeed in blowing up an asteroid the size of Texas. What if a piece the size of Dallas is left? Wouldn't that be big enough to destroy life on Earth? What about a piece the size of Austin? Let's face it: Even an object the size of that big Wal-Mart outside Abilene would pretty much clean us out, if you count the parking lot.\r\n\r\nTexas is a big state, but as a celestial object, it wouldn't be able to generate much gravity. Yet when the astronauts get to the asteroid, they walk around on it as if the gravity is the same as on Earth. There's no sensation of weightlessness--until it's needed, that is, and then a lunar buggy flies across a jagged canyon, Evel Knievel-style.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins with a Charlton Heston narration telling us about the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. Then we get the masterful title card, \"65 Million Years Later.\" The next scenes show an amateur astronomer spotting the object. We see top-level meetings at the Pentagon and in the White House. We meet Billy Bob Thornton, head of Mission Control in Houston, which apparently functions like a sports bar with a big screen for the fans, but no booze. Then we see ordinary people whose lives will be Changed Forever by the events to come. This stuff is all off the shelf--there's hardly an original idea in the movie.\r\n\r\n\"Armageddon\" reportedly used the services of nine writers. Why did it need any? The dialogue is either shouted one-liners or romantic drivel. \"It's gonna blow!\" is used so many times, I wonder if every single writer used it once, and then sat back from his word processor with a contented smile on his face, another day's work done.\r\n\r\nDisaster movies always have little vignettes of everyday life. The dumbest in \"Armageddon\" involves two Japanese tourists in a New York taxi. After meteors turn an entire street into a flaming wasteland, the woman complains, \"I want to go shopping!\" I hope in Japan that line is redubbed as \"Nothing can save us but Gamera!\" Meanwhile, we wade through a romantic subplot involving Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck. Liv plays Bruce Willis' daughter. Ben is Willis' best driller (now, now). Bruce finds Liv in Ben's bunk on an oil platform and chases Ben all over the rig, trying to shoot him. (You would think the crew would be preoccupied by the semi-destruction of Manhattan, but it's never mentioned after it happens.) Helicopters arrive to take Willis to the mainland so he can head up the mission to save mankind, etc., and he insists on using only crews from his own rig--especially Affleck, who is \"like a son.\" That means Liv and Ben have a heart-rending parting scene. What is it about cinematographers and Liv Tyler? She is a beautiful young woman, but she's always being photographed while flat on her back, with her brassiere riding up around her chin and lots of wrinkles in her neck from trying to see what some guy is doing. (In this case, Affleck is tickling her navel with animal crackers.) Tyler is obviously a beneficiary of Take Your Daughter to Work Day. She's not only on the oil rig, but she attends training sessions with her dad and her boyfriend, hangs out in Mission Control and walks onto landing strips right next to guys wearing foil suits.\r\n\r\nCharacters in this movie actually say: \"I wanted to say ... that I'm sorry,\" \"We're not leaving them behind!,\" \"Guys--the clock is ticking!\" and \"This has turned into a surrealistic nightmare!\" Steve Buscemi, a crew member who is diagnosed with \"space dementia,\" looks at the asteroid's surface and adds \"This place is like Dr. Seuss' worst nightmare.\" Quick--which Seuss book is he thinking of? There are several Red Digital Readout scenes, in which bombs tick down to zero. Do bomb designers do that for the convenience of interested onlookers who happen to be standing next to a bomb? There's even a retread of the classic scene where they're trying to disconnect the timer, and they have to decide whether to cut the red wire or the blue wire. The movie has forgotten that *this is not a terrorist bomb,* but a standard-issue U.S. military bomb, being defused by a military guy who is on board specifically because he knows about this bomb. A guy like that, the first thing he should know is, red or blue? \"Armageddon\" is loud, ugly and fragmented. Action sequences are cut together at bewildering speed out of hundreds of short edits, so that we can't see for sure what's happening, or how, or why. Important special-effects shots (such as the asteroid) have a murkiness of detail, and the movie cuts away before we get a good look. The few \"dramatic\" scenes consist of the sonorous recitation of ancient cliches. Only near the end, when every second counts, does the movie slow down: Life on Earth is about to end, but the hero delays saving the planet in order to recite cornball farewell platitudes.\r\n\r\nStaggering into the silence of the theater lobby after the ordeal was over, I found a big poster that was fresh off the presses with the quotes of junket blurbsters. \"It will obliterate your senses!\" reports David Gillin, who obviously writes autobiographically. \"It will suck the air right out of your lungs!\" vows Diane Kaminsky.\r\n\r\nIf it does, consider it a mercy killing.", date_published: "July 1, 1998", year: 1998, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/armageddon.jpg").open, excerpt: "'Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. \"Armageddon\" is cut together like its own highlights.

  {title: "Body of Evidence", content: "I've seen comedies with fewer laughs than \"Body of Evidence,\" and this is a movie that isn't even trying to be funny. It's an excruciatingly incompetent entry in the \"Basic Instinct\" genre, filled with lines that only a screenwriter could love, and burdened with a plot that confuses mystery with confusion.\r\n\r\nThe movie stars Madonna, who after \"Bloodhounds of Broadway,\" \"Shanghai Surprise\" and \"Who's That Girl?\" now nails down her title as the queen of movies that were bad ideas right from the beginning. She plays a kinky dominatrix involved in ingenious and hazardous sex with an aging millionaire who has a bad heart. He dies after an evening's entertainment, and Madonna is charged with his murder.\r\n\r\nBut she's innocent, she protests - and indeed there is another obvious suspect, the millionaire's private secretary (Anne Archer), who is also his spurned former lover. Willem Dafoe plays the defense attorney who firmly believes Madonna is innocent, or in any event very sexy, and Joe Mantegna has the Hamilton Burger role.\r\n\r\nThe movie takes place in Portland, Ore. - a city small enough, Madonna volunteers from the witness stand, that she once dated a guy who dated a girl who dated Mantegna. That's a typical exchange in the courtroom scenes, which involve Dafoe being reprimanded by the judge for just about every breath he draws.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether to blame the director, the cinematographer or the editor for some of the inept choices in this movie. One example: Dafoe is addressing his opening remarks to the jury, and the camera pulls focus so that we see an attractive young female juror sitting in the front row. She gives Dafoe an unmistakable look. We in the audience are alerted that the movie is establishing her for a later payoff. We're wrong. She's just an extra trying to grab some extra business.\r\n\r\nBut enough on the technical side. What about the story here? It has to be seen to be believed - something I do not advise. There's all kinds of murky plot debris involving nasal spray with cocaine in it, ghosts from the past, bizarre sex, and lots of nudity. We are asked to believe that Madonna lives on a luxury houseboat, where she parades in front of the windows naked at all hours, yet somehow doesn't attract a crowd, not even of appreciative lobstermen. What does she dedicate her life to? She answers that question in one of the movie's funniest lines, which unfortunately cannot be printed here.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to eroticism, \"Body of Evidence\" is like Madonna's new book. It knows the words but not the music. All of the paraphernalia and lore of S & M sexuality are here, but none of the passion or even enjoyment. We are told by one witness that sex with the Madonna character is intense. It turns out later he's not a very reliable witness.", date_published: "January 15, 1993", year: 1993, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/body-of-evidence.jpg").open, excerpt: "'The movie stars Madonna, who after \"Bloodhounds of Broadway,\" \"Shanghai Surprise\" and \"Who's That Girl?\" now nails down her title as the queen of movies that were bad ideas right from the beginning.'", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/body-of-evidence.jpg").open},
  {title: "Pearl Harbor", content: "\"Pearl Harbor\" is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle. Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality. The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialog, it will not be because you admire them.\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers seem to have aimed the film at an audience that may not have heard of Pearl Harbor, or perhaps even of World War Two. This is the Our Weekly Reader version. If you have the slightest knowledge of the events in the film, you will know more than it can tell you. There is no sense of history, strategy or context; according to this movie, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut off its oil supply, and they were down to an 18 month reserve. Would going to war restore the fuel sources? Did they perhaps also have imperialist designs? Movie doesn't say.\r\n\r\nSo shaky is the film's history that at the end, when Jimmy Doolittle's Tokyo raiders crash-land in China, they're shot at by Japanese patrols with only a murky throwaway explanation about the Sino-Japanese war already underway. I predict some viewers will leave the theater sincerely confused about why there were Japanese in China.\r\n\r\nAs for the movie's portrait of the Japanese themselves, it is so oblique that Japanese audiences will find little to complain about apart from the fact that they play such a small role in their own raid. There are several scenes where the Japanese high command debates military tactics, but all of their dialog is strictly expository; they state facts but do not emerge with personalities or passions. Only Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) is seen as an individual, and his dialog seems to have been singled out with the hindsight of history. Congratulated on a brilliant raid, he demurs, \"A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.\" And later, \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.\" Do you imagine at any point the Japanese high command engaged in the 1941 Japanese equivalent of exchanging high-fives and shouting \"Yes!\" while pumping their fists in the air? Not in this movie, where the Japanese seem to have been melancholy even at the time about the regrettable need to play such a negative role in such a positive Hollywood film.\r\n\r\nThe American side of the story centers on two childhood friends from Tennessee with the standard-issue screenplay names Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). They enter the Army Air Corps and both fall in love with the same nurse, Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale)--first Rafe falls for her, and then, after he is reported dead, Danny. Their first date is subtitled \"Three Months Later\" and ends with Danny, having apparently read the subtitle, telling Evelyn, \"Don't let it be three months before I see you again, okay?\" That gets almost as big a laugh as her line to Rafe, \"I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you.\" That kind of bad laugh would have been sidestepped in a more literate screenplay, but our hopes are not high after an early newsreel report that the Germans are bombing \"downtown London\"--a difficult target, since although there is such a place as \"central London,\" at no time in 2,000 years has London ever had anything described by anybody as a \"downtown.\" There is not a shred of conviction or chemistry in the love triangle, which results after Rafe returns alive to Hawaii shortly before the raid on Pearl Harbor and is angry at Evelyn for falling in love with Danny, inspiring her timeless line, \"I didn't even know until the day you turned up alive--and then all this happened.\" Evelyn is a hero in the aftermath of the raid, performing triage by using her lipstick to separate the wounded who should be treated from those left to die. In a pointless stylistic choice, director Michael Bay and cinematographer John Schwartzman shoot some of the hospital scenes in soft focus, some in sharp focus, some blurred. Why? I understand it's to obscure details deemed too gory for the PG-13 rating. (Why should the carnage at Pearl Harbor be toned down to PG-13 in the first place?) In the newsreel sequences, the movie fades in and out of black and white with almost amusing haste, while the newsreel announcer sounds not like a period voice but like a Top-40 deejay in an echo chamber.\r\n\r\nThe most involving material in the film comes at the end, when Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) leads his famous raid on Tokyo, flying Army bombers off the decks of Navy carriers and hoping to crash-land in China.\r\n\r\nHe and his men were heroes, and their story would make a good movie (and indeed has: \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\"). Another hero in the movie is the African-American cook Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who because of his race was not allowed to touch a gun in the racist pre-war Navy, but opens fire during the raid, shoots down two planes, and saves the life of his captain. He's shown getting a medal. Nice to see an African-American in the movie, but the almost total absence of Asians in 1941 Hawaii is inexplicable.\r\n\r\nAs for the raid itself, a little goes a long way. What is the point, really, of more than half an hour of planes bombing ships, of explosions and fireballs, of roars on the soundtrack and bodies flying through the air and people running away from fighters that are strafing them? How can it be entertaining or moving when it's simply about the most appalling slaughter? Why do the filmmakers think we want to see this, unrelieved by intelligence, viewpoint or insight? It was a terrible, terrible day. Three thousand died in all. This is not a movie about them.\r\n\r\nIt is an unremarkable action movie; Pearl Harbor supplies the subject, but not the inspiration.", date_published: "May 25, 2001", year: 2001, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/pearl-harbor-poster.jpg").open, excerpt: "'\"Pearl Harbor\" is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle.'", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/pearl-harbor-poster.jpg").open},
  {title: "Catwoman", content: "\"Catwoman\" is a movie about Halle Berry's beauty, sex appeal, figure, eyes, lips and costume design. It gets those right. Everything else is secondary, except for the plot, which is tertiary. What a letdown. The filmmakers have given great thought to photographing Berry, who looks fabulous, and little thought to providing her with a strong character, story, supporting characters or action sequences. In a summer when \"Spider-Man 2\" represents the state of the art, \"Catwoman\" is tired and dated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the movie's faults are many, the crucial one is that we never get any sense of what it feels like to turn into a catwoman. The strength of \"Spider-Man 2\" is in the ambivalence that Peter Parker has about being part nerdy student, part superhero. In \"Catwoman,\" where are the scenes where a woman comes to grip with the fact that her entire nature and even her species seems to have changed?\r\n\r\nBerry plays Patience Phillips, a designer for an ad agency, who dies and is reborn after Midnight, a cat with ties to ancient Egypt, breathes new life into her. She becomes Catwoman, but what is a catwoman? She can leap like a cat, strut around on top of her furniture, survive great falls and hiss. Berry looks great doing these things, and spends a lot of time on all fours, inspiring our almost unseemly gratitude for her cleavage.\r\n\r\nShe gobbles down tuna and sushi. Her eyes have vertical pupils instead of round ones. She sleeps on a shelf. The movie doesn't get into the litter box situation. What does she think about all of this? Why isn't she more astonished that it has happened to her? How does it affect her relationship with that cute cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt)?\r\n\r\nThe movie makes it clear that they make love at least once, but we don't see that happening because \"Catwoman,\" a film that was born to be rated R, has been squeezed into the PG-13 category to rake in every last teenage dollar. From what we know about Catwoman, her style in bed has probably changed along with everything else, and sure enough, the next day he notices a claw mark on his shoulder. Given the MPAA's preference for violence over sex, this might have been one sex scene that could have sneaked in under the PG-13.\r\n\r\nCatwoman dresses like a dominatrix, with the high heels and the leather skirt, brassiere, mask and whip. But why? Because the costume sketches looked great, is my opinion. The film gives her a plot that could have been phoned in from the 1960s: She works for a corporation that's introducing a new beauty product that gives women eternal youth, unless they stop taking it, in which case they look like burn victims. When Patience stumbles over this unfortunate side effect, she is attacked by security guards, flushed out of a waste pipe and is dead when Midnight finds her.\r\n\r\nSoon she has a dual identity: Patience by day, Catwoman by night. She already knows Tom Lone. They met when she crawled out of her window and balanced on an air conditioner to rescue Midnight, and Tom thought she was committing suicide and saved her after she slipped. Uh, huh. That meeting begins a romance between Patience and Tom that is remarkable for its complete lack of energy, passion and chemistry. If the movie had been 10 minutes longer, it would have needed a scene where they sigh and sadly agree their relationship is just not working out. One of those things. Not meant to be.\r\n\r\nThe villains are Laurel and Georges Hedare (Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson). He runs the cosmetics company and fires his wife as its model when she turns 40. She is not to be trifled with, especially not in a movie where the big fight scene is a real catfight, so to speak, between the two women. Stone's character is laughably one-dimensional, but then that's a good fit for this movie, in which none of the characters suggest any human dimensions and seem to be posing more than relating. Take Georges, for example, whose obnoxious mannerisms are so grotesque he's like the \"Saturday Night Live\" version of Vincent Price.\r\n\r\nAmong many silly scenes, the silliest has to be the Ferris wheel sequence, which isn't even as thrilling as the one in \"The Notebook.\" Wouldn't you just know that after the wheel stalls, the operator would recklessly strip the gears, and the little boy riding alone would be in a chair where the guard rail falls off, and then the seat comes loose, and then the wheel tries to shake him loose and no doubt would try to electrocute him if it could.\r\n\r\nThe score by Klaus Badelt is particularly annoying; it faithfully mirrors every action, with what occasionally sounds like a karoke rhythm section. The director, whose name is Pitof, was probably issued with two names at birth and would be wise to use the other one on his next project.\r\n\r\n", date_published: "July 19, 2004", year: 2004, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/catwoman.jpg").open, excerpt: "'The director, whose name is Pitof, was probably issued with two names at birth and would be wise to use the other one on his next project.'", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/catwoman.jpg").open},
  {title: "Sex and the City 2", content: "Morecambe and Wise did it. Del and Rodney Trotter did it. Even On the Buses went to Wales. When a television show, no matter how popular, is getting a bit tired, its makers tend to ring up the local travel agent, and set about transplanting its cast and crew for jolly japes in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nNow it’s happened in Sex and the City 2. Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda - women who, for a certain kind of armchair fantasist, embodied all that was most glamorous and seductive about New York - have decamped to Abu Dhabi.\r\n\r\nIt’s only for a week, but it’s a good time for them to take stock of their lives.\r\n\r\nCarrie has finally snagged Big, but misses the excitement of evenings out on the town. Charlotte’s worried that husband Harry is smitten with the new and very bra-less nanny. Samantha’s overdoing pills and ointments to stave off the menopause. Miranda’s packed in her job because she can’t hear her own voice at work.\r\n\r\nIn short, they’re all getting older, and developing a new set of neuroses to cultivate between their continued shopping frenzies.\r\n\r\n\"Neuroses\" is a heavy way of putting it. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker, looking, if you happen to go for human pipe-cleaners, absolutely fabulous), frets: “I’ve been cheating on fashion with furniture.”\r\n\r\nShe may be an in-demand journalist whose bestselling books - the most recent one is entitled \"I Do. Do I?\" - tap into the secret chambers of every overachieving thirty- and fortysomething female heart, but she still finds it hard to understand why men sometimes prefer to stay at home watching black-and-white movies on TV rather than slurping cocktails at corporate parties. Because it’s, er, preferable?\r\n\r\nAnyway, off the girls trot, all-expenses-paid, on a mission of hope to the UAE.\r\n\r\nInspired by Barack Obama’s conciliatory overtures to the Islamic world, they’re planning to set up a policy institute that will help future East-West dialogues. Sorry, I meant planning to slurp cocktails, gawk at the packets of every himbo ex-pat they bump into, and coo over how cheap the shoes and beaded fabrics are at local souks.\r\n\r\nThe New Middle East! they holler. It’s very much like the old New York. Right down to Samantha (Kim Cattrall) getting into trouble for sucking at a hookah like it’s some guy she’s just pulled at a downtown bar.\r\n\r\nThe first Sex and the City film got a free pass from loyal viewers of the television series. This one will try their patience.\r\n\r\nThe clothes for one are mostly dreadful. Sarah Jessica Parker looks like a cross between Wurzel Gummidge and Bride of Chucky; Miranda looks badly embalmed. In one scene where the gang appears coming over a dune in the Arabian desert, they resemble a karaoke tribute act to the Village People.\r\nWorse, they don’t act like a gang, appearing as awkward and semi-detached in each other’s company as if they were attending a school reunion bash.\r\n\r\nIs it because they’re so much older and still carrying on like members of an Imelda Marcos-organised hen party? Or is it that we’re older, being asked by the government to tighten our belts and look askance at the spend-spend habits that got us into the current recession, to the extent that there seems something not so much escapist as straight-out vapid about Carrie and her pals?\r\n\r\nI hope Art Malik, Omid Djalili and all those other actors happy to add nu-Orientalist \"colour\" to this film got a tidy wage packet in return for their brownface turns.\r\n\r\nIt’s too easy to take pot shots at the film’s diagnosis of contemporary Middle Eastern affairs (basically: if only the sheikhs would let braying Upper East Siders hit on random dudes and let their local women show off the designer clothes they crave more than equality), but what’s really odd, given that writer-director Michael Patrick King is gay, is the strangeness of its opening scenes in which Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone) and Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson) get hitched.\r\n\r\nAt this none-more-campy wedding, Liza Minnelli performs a tush-shaking version of Beyonce’s Single Ladies, Big (Chris Noth) gets hit on by the first guy he meets, and all the sisters giggle about the \"Gay Wedding\" as if they’re boy-men from a Judd Apatow movie rather than long-term friends of the pair getting married.\r\n\r\nSex and the City 2 goes on for half a lifetime, brandishes enough product placements to embarrass a Formula One driver, and contains approximately three good one-liners (Samantha’s hope that a Danish architect could be the “Lawrence of my Labia” the best of them).\r\n\r\nI lost count of the number of times the filmmakers dropped the word “sparkle” into the script; no doubt they thought they were going for gold, but they’ve created a load of Ratners.", date_published: "May 25, 2010", year: 2010, writer_id: 2, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/sex-and-the-city-2.jpg").open, excerpt: "'The clothes for one are mostly dreadful.

  {title: "Grace of Monaco", content: "It's traditional for Cannes to start with something spectacular. This is certainly no exception. It is a film so awe-inspiringly wooden that it is basically a fire-risk. The cringe-factor is ionospherically high. A fleet of ambulances may have to be stationed outside the Palais to take tuxed audiences to hospital afterwards to have their toes uncurled under general anesthetic.\r\n\r\nGrace of Monaco is a stately and swooning homage to Princess Grace, formerly Grace Kelly, focusing on her alleged courage in keeping plucky little Monaco safe for tax-avoiding billionaires. This was during its supremely parochial and uninteresting 1962 face-off with Charles De Gaulle, who wanted to absorb the principality and its monies into France's national bosom. So can Grace, by finally sacrificing her movie career on the altar of this cockamamie Ruritanian state, and flaunting her martyred couture loveliness, win the respect of the Monégasque folk and even the grumpy old Général himself?\r\n\r\nThe resulting film about this fantastically boring crisis is like a 104-minute Chanel ad, only without the subtlety and depth. Princess Grace herself is played by Nicole Kidman, wafting around the Palace with dewy-eyed features and slightly parted lips which make her look like a grown-up Bambi after a couple of cocktails, suddenly remembering his mother's violent death in the forest.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem that long since we endured a horrendous biopic of Princess Diana, that other super-rich blonde pasionaria — played by Naomi Watts. As audiences reeled into the foyer after that, they comforted themselves with the thought that surely things couldn't get worse. Surely they wouldn't be forced to endure another badly acted, badly directed film about a wealthy and self-pitying royal?\r\n\r\nHow very wrong. I can now actually imagine a creepy science-fiction short story about someone going back to prehistoric days in a time machine, killing a tiny trilobite, and then coming to the present to find everything the same, only now it's Naomi Watts playing Grace and Nicole Kidman playing Diana.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins with a sketch of jowly and adorable old Alfred Hitchcock (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) coming to Monaco hoping to tempt Grace back to the movies, proffering a juicy leading role in his latest film, Marnie. Two recent dramas about Hitchcock's troubled life — one for cinema, a better one for TV — have in fact begun in approximately the same way, but then followed the troubled director back to the US. Here, we stay with Kidman's Grace, who is effectively confronted by a dilemma. Should she return to her selfish, shallow life in Hollywood or build a new shallow, selfish life in Monte Carlo?\r\n\r\nAnd so the terrible mental turmoil begins. She pores over the script, late at night, in bed, with stylish reading glasses. During the day, she tries her darnedest to impress the wittering ladies of Monaco by entering into the spirit of charity galas and such. She worries about plotting against her at court. She consults her confidant, one Father Francis Tucker, a sorrowing priest who is evidently permitted the familiarity of calling her \"Gracie\", played with conviction by Frank Langella.\r\n\r\nThen, in order to bone up on the history and culture of Monaco — and perhaps because the situation is not yet sufficiently gay — Grace consults a local nobleman, Count Fernando D'Aillieres, played by Derek Jacobi. He scampers about the hillsides, with Grace in tow, filling her in on all the tiresome details, while also presuming to give her tips on acting and deportment. (Surely as an Oscar-winning star she knows this stuff already?) Jacobi has a little fun with the part, although it needed Ian McKellen to come on, playing the Count's ageing houseboy.\r\n\r\nBut how about the people for whom it is all supposed to be about? Her, erm, husband and children? Well, the absolute indifference shown by Grace to her kids here is startling. And what of Prince Rainier himself, that fairy-tale prince for whom she gave it all up? He is played by Tim Roth, who gives a very cigarette-smoking, glasses-wearing, moustache-having performance. He is always leaning in his chair, leaning against door frames — looking through his glasses, and smoking. What is this remarkable head of state thinking about? As performed by Tim Roth, it looks like he is thinking about how much he regrets taking this appalling role, and how inadequate he considers his fee, whatever it is.\r\n\r\nAn interesting, complex film could be made about a talented woman who decides to make the best of being trapped in an imperfect marriage.

  {title: "White House Down", content: "Everyone in White House Down is an idiot, clinically insane, a cliche or a vehicle for shameless exploitation. Some characters go for the combo platter. For example, one guy’s an idiot AND insane.\r\n\r\nJust three months after the release of Olympus Has Fallen, with Gerard Butler as a former U.S. Army Ranger with a checkered past who must singlehandedly save the White House from a terrorist attack, we get Channing Tatum as a veteran with a checkered past who must singlehandedly . . . you know. Olympus Has Fallen was a decidedly mediocre film. And yet it’s The Manchurian Candidate meets the original Die Hard meets In the Line of Fire compared to this cartoonish, offensive, overblown, clanging, steaming piece of . . . cinema.\r\n\r\nLet’s see who’s all here. We’ve got Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer, the peace-loving, Jordan sneakers-wearing, Nicorette-chewing POTUS intent on withdrawing all troops from the Middle East, to the dismay of many special interests. (“You ever heard of the military-industrial complex?” he says at one point. No, never. Tell us more, Mr. President!)\r\n\r\nPOTUS always carries a gold pocket watch that Mary Todd Lincoln once gave to Abraham Lincoln to remind him he only had so much time to make a difference. We’re told this was a present from the first lady, who must have found it on e-Bay or something.\r\n\r\nChanning Tatum is Cale, a Capitol-area police officer who dreams of becoming Secret Service. Joey King is his 11-year-old daughter, Emily, a precocious political junkie who of course resents her father because he’s never around. He just missed the school talent show! Divorced dads in movies NEVER miss the school talent show!\r\n\r\nMaggie Gyllenhaal is Cale’s ex-hookup from college, now a top-level Secret Service agent. James Woods is the head of the president’s Secret Service detail, and we know what his deal is the minute we see him saying goodbye to his wife as he leaves for work. Jason Clarke is Hans Gruber — I’m sorry, Stenz, the baddest of the bad guys. Richard Jenkins is the Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\nIt's a crowded cast, and with a bloated running time of 137 minutes, there’s room for everyone in White House Down to spout unintentionally funny lines and generally embarrass himself. In the world of White House Down, it's comically easy for a band of domestic terrorists to take over the White House, repeatedly gunning down arguably the most inept Secret Service and military personnel ever seen on film.\r\n\r\nIn classic Die Hard fashion, our boy Cale just happens to be in the wrong place at the right time, and before you can say “yippie-ki-yay,” he’s in a sleeveless T-shirt and picking off the bad guys one by one, communicating with various folks on hand-held devices and of course desperately trying to save his daughter. (Saving her life will TOTALLY make up for missing that talent show.) And that poor kid. She witnesses multiple murders, as innocent people are shot at point-blank range. She gets slapped around and pushed around. She weeps while a bad guy holds a gun to her head. Yeah, that’s some PG-13 entertainment right there.\r\n\r\nEmily also performs some remarkable acts of bravery, including a YouTube moment that goes viral and results in some portrayals of modern media news coverage so off-key you’d think someone from another planet was the film’s screenwriter. She also participates in a scene designed to stir our emotions that will almost certainly elicit gales of laughter from audiences.\r\n\r\nI have seen more than 3,000 movies in the last 15 years, and the scene in question is so egregiously stupid, I’m still shaking my head days later. (Which looks really weird when I’m driving.)\r\n\r\nI know: White House Down isn’t supposed to be some gritty thriller. It’s just a big, loud, popcorn movie from Roland Emmerich, director of Independence Day, Godzilla, 10,000 B.C. and 2012, among other assaults on the senses. (OK, Independence Day was ridiculous good fun. Those other titles were just awful.) But Transformers 3 was subtle compared to this nonsense.\r\n\r\nEmmerich doesn’t flinch as he puts a child character in constant jeopardy, shamelessly borrows from better movies and constantly insults our intelligence with jingoistic manipulation and cheesy one-liners. Between scenes of escalating violence and carnage in and around the White House, we see good actors reciting bad dialogue with various degrees of enthusiasm. Tatum and Foxx seem to know they’re in a dopey buddy movie. Jenkins and Woods, among others, are saddled with the impossible task of making us believe they are serious, substantial people neck-deep in a pivotal moment in American history.\r\n\r\nNot since Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges in Airplane! have I seen a more impressive display of keeping a straight face.

  {title: "After Earth", content: "After starring in the sci-fi flick \"After Earth,\" Jaden Smith may want to rethink his future as an actor.\r\n\r\nBasically, this is Smith and his real-life son, Jaden (both affecting ridiculous mid-Atlantic accents) talking the audience to death for something like 90 minutes before the closing credits.\r\n\r\nI’m giving it one star because Smith’s longtime enablers at Sony apparently encouraged him to whittle this humorless sci-fi epic down from a much longer movie.\r\n\r\nThe back story in the opening narration — Earth’s evacuation following a vague environmental catastrophe — is boiled down to a couple of sentences.\r\n\r\nA thousand years later, Smith is the aptly named Cypher, a general in the United Ranger Corps, the military arm of the former Earthlings who have settled on a distant planet and produced exceedingly dull descendants.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of retirement, Cypher decides to take his 14-year-old son, Kitai, along on his last mission.\r\n\r\nThe two have a frosty relationship because, we’re told, Kitai blames his frequently absent dad for his sister’s death. I have a sneaking suspicion that the fact Cypher wears a perpetual scowl probably doesn’t help things.\r\n\r\nA meteor shower forces their spacecraft to crash land on Earth, where Cypher and son are the only survivors in a hostile environment. \"Do exactly as I tell you, and we will survive!\" the disabled Cypher barks at Kitai in an order that would probably sound better if papa Smith had delivered it as a rap lyric.\r\n\r\nMost of the film consists of Kitai traveling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon, and then, even less interestingly, trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal.\r\n\r\nThere are exactly two action sequences — brief pursuit by what look like deranged orangutans, and a climactic battle with a badly executed special effect that’s supposed to represent a deadly extraterrestrial.\r\n\r\nEleven years and several progressively more dreadful movies after \"Signs,\" director M.

What’s more, while Jaden Smith pulled off the remake of \"The Karate Kid,\" he’s not quite a good enough actor (or sufficiently charismatic) to hold the screen by himself in scene after scene.\r\n\r\nWe’re left to ponder how Earth remains so green and leafy when the temperatures drop below freezing every night, or why all that plant life can’t supply sufficient oxygen so that Kitai doesn’t have to rely on an imperiled supply of inhalers.\r\n\r\nHe is able to receive Dad’s overbearing self-help lectures via a communication device — which, like all the 31st-century technology on view, is surprisingly more fragile than anything you could buy at the Apple store these days.\r\n\r\n\"Fear is not real, it is a production of your imagination!\" Cypher exhorts Kitai. \"Danger is very real but fear is a choice!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so is avoiding the crashing bore that is \"After Earth.\"", date_published: "May 30, 2013", year: 2013, writer_id: 5, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/after-earth.jpg").open, excerpt: "'Basically, this is Smith and his real-life son, Jaden (both affecting ridiculous mid-Atlantic accents) talking the audience to death for something like 90 minutes before the closing credits.'", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/after-earth.jpg").open},

  {title: "Hellbound: Hellraiser II", content: "Generally speaking, there are two kinds of nightmares: the kind that you actually have, and the kind they make into movies. Real nightmares usually involve frustration or public embarrassment. In the frustrating ones, a loved one is trying to tell you something and you can't understand them, or they're in danger and you can't help them. In the embarrassing ones, it's the day of the final exam and you forgot to attend the classes, or you're in front of a crowd and can't think of anything to say, or you wandered into the hotel lobby without any clothes on and nobody has noticed you yet - but they're about to.\r\n\r\nThose are scary nightmares, all right, and sometimes they turn up in the movies. But \"Hellbound: Hellraiser II\" contains the kinds of nightmares that occur only in movies, because our real dreams have low budgets and we can't afford expensive special effects. The movie begins a few hours after the original \"Hellbound\" ended. A young girl named Kirsty has been placed in a hospital after a night in which she was tortured by the flayed corpses of her parents, who were under the supervision of the demons of hell. What this girl needs is a lot of rest and a set of those positive-thinking cassettes they advertise late at night on cable TV.\r\n\r\nBut no such luck. The hospital is simply another manifestation of the underworld, hell is all around us, we are powerless in its grip, and before long Kristy and a newfound friend named Tiffany are hurtling down the corridors of the damned. Give or take a detail or two, that's the story. \"Hellbound: Hellraiser II\" is like some kind of avant-garde film strip in which there is no beginning, no middle, no end, but simply a series of gruesome images that can be watched in any order.\r\n\r\nThe images have been constructed with a certain amount of care and craftsmanship; the technical credits on this movie run to four single-spaced pages. We see lots of bodies that have been skinned alive, so that the blood still glistens on the exposed muscles. We see creatures who have been burned and mutilated and twisted into grotesque shapes and condemned for eternity to unspeakable and hopeless tortures.\r\n\r\nWe hear deep, rasping laughter as the denizens of hell chortle over the plight of the terrified girls. And we hear their desperate voices calling to each other.\r\n\r\n\"Kirsty!\" we hear. And \"Tiffany!\" And \"Kirsty!!!\" and \"Tiffany!!!\" And \"Kirstiyyyyyyy!!!!!\" And \"Tiffanyyyyyyy!!!!!\" I'm afraid this is another one of those movies that violates the First Rule of Repetition of Names, which states that when the same names are repeated in a movie more than four times a minute for more than three minutes in a row, the audience breaks out into sarcastic laughter, and some of the ruder members are likely to start shouting \"Kirsty!\" and \"Tiffany!\" at the screen.\r\n\r\nBut this movie violates more rules than the First Rule of Repetition. It also violates a basic convention of story construction, which suggests that we should get at least a vague idea of where the story began and where it might be headed. This movie has no plot in a conventional sense. It is simply a series of ugly and bloody episodes strung together one after another like a demo tape by a perverted special-effects man. There is nothing the heroines can do to understand or change their plight and no way we can get involved in their story.\r\n\r\nThat makes \"Hellbound: Hellraiser II\" an ideal movie for audiences with little taste and atrophied attention spans who want to glance at the screen occasionally and ascertain that something is still happening up there.

In the two hours of this film that I saw, there were no scenes of joy, natural pleasure, or good sensual cheer. There was, instead, a nauseating excursion into base and sad fantasies.\r\n\r\nYou have heard that this is a violent film. But who could have suspected how violent, and to what vile purpose, it really is? In this film, there are scenes depicting a man whose urinary tract is closed, and who has gallons of wine poured down his throat. His bursting stomach is punctured with a sword. There is a scene in which a man is emasculated, and his genitals thrown to dogs, who eagerly eat them on the screen. There are scenes of decapitation, evisceration, rape, bestiality, sadomasochism, necrophilia.\r\n\r\nThese scenes -- indeed, the movie itself -- reflect a curiously distanced sensibility. Nobody in this film really seems to be there. Not the famous actors like Malcolm McDowell and (very briefly) Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud, whose scenes have been augmented by additional porn shot later with other people and inserted to spice things up. Not the director (who removed his credit from the film). Not the writer (what in the world can it mean that this movie is \"Adapted from an Original Screenplay by Gore Vidal\"?) Not even the sound track. The actors never quite seem to be speaking their own words, which were so badly dubbed in later that the dialogue never seems to be emerging from the drama itself.\r\n\r\nThe film even fails to involve itself in the action. \"Caligula\" has been photographed and directed with such clumsiness and inelegance that pieces of action do not seem to flow together, the plot is incomprehensible, the events are frequently framed as if the camera was not sure where it was, and everything is shot in muddy, ugly, underlit dungeon tones. The music Is also execrable.\r\n\r\nSo what are we left with? A movie, I am afraid, that may be invulnerable to a review like this one. There are no doubt people who believe that if this movie is as bad as I say it is, it must be worth seeing. People who simply cannot believe any film could be this vile. Some of those people were walking out of the Davis before I did Saturday night; others were sitting, depressed, in the lobby. That should not, I suppose, be surprising.\r\n\r\nThe human being is a most curious animal. often ready to indulge himself in his base Inclinations, but frequently reluctant to trust his better Instincts. Surely people know, going in, that \"Caligula\" is worthless. Surely they know there are other movies in town that are infinitely better. Yet here they are at \"Caligula.\" It is very sad.\r\n\r\nMy friendly recommendation is that they see \"The Great Santini,\" to freshen their minds and learn to laugh and care again in a movie. People learn fast. \"This movie,\" said the lady in front of me at the drinking fountain, \"is the worst piece of sh*t I have ever seen.\"", date_published: "September 22, 1980 ", year: 1980, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/caligula.jpg").open}, excerpt: "'\"Caligula\" is sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash.

  {title: "The Last Face", content: "Sean Penn turns African strife into a two-hour perfume commercial with “The Last Face,” veering between gauzy impressionism and shrieky melodrama with his latest directorial effort.\r\n\r\nPenn’s own humanitarian work is well-documented, including raising millions of dollars for Haitian relief efforts. Clearly, his intentions here are genuine. But his execution is laughably pretentious, crammed as it is with dramatic lighting, repeated use of artful slow motion and wailing vocals, including some from longtime pal Eddie Vedder.\r\n\r\n“The Last Face” shines a light on the plight of war-torn lands like Liberia and South Sudan, a topic most moviegoers probably don’t want to think about. It’s too far away, too daunting, too unpleasant. But Penn ultimately fetishizes such suffering, making it self-consciously beautiful through hand-held camerawork, off-kilter angles, extreme close-ups of eyes and fingers and glittering lens flares. Meanwhile, the Africans themselves fade into the background, rendered less as individuals than types: proud fathers, strong mothers and adorable children, all photogenic.\r\n\r\nBecause the real story at the film’s center is a romance between gorgeous people with big hearts and a taste for danger: Charlize Theron as the determined director of an international aid agency and Javier Bardem as a roguish, globetrotting doctor. Erin Dignam’s script hops around in time and place, tracing the couple’s star-crossed courtship over the course of a decade and various countries. But while Theron is saddled with breathy narration spelling out how she feels about everything, all the time (“Before I met Miguel, I was an idea I had. I didn’t really exist.”), the film as a whole doesn’t seem particularly interested in examining why this region of the world is ravaged.\r\n\r\nInstead, we get a close-up of Bardem’s Dr. Miguel Leon washing his filthy feet in a sink, which dissolves into a slow-motion shot of a helicopter flying over a devastated refugee camp. As Dr. Wren Petersen, Theron appears at the film’s start on stage at a glitzy charity dinner, appealing to wealthy donors in a slinky black dress. Then the film cuts abruptly to the events of 10 days earlier: gun fighting and carnage, with a blood-soaked Miguel tending to victims who were caught in the crossfire. Despite Wren’s frequent, hand-holding voiceover, the story’s many temporal leaps often result in confusion.\r\n\r\nEventually, we see how the two fell in love back in 2003, flirting with each other at a Sierra Leone refugee camp with giggly tooth brushing serving as foreplay. “Are you a playboy, Miguel?” Wren asks playfully. And then it’s back to the artful squalor.\r\n\r\nBut the core of “The Last Face” is, ostensibly, a mystery: What happened to this couple who fell in love quickly, passionately and ill-advisedly? What tore them apart, leaving Wren lying in bed with depression for three days (but still looking stylishly tousled)? And, more crucially, can you bring yourself to care?\r\n\r\nThe rift may have something to do with the fact that Wren used to toil away in the trenches and is now buttoned-down in the boardroom. “Saving lives is a serious mission,” she tells members of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva—and us, as well, as if we didn’t know.\r\n\r\nTo reinforce that point, Penn’s imagery can indeed be harrowing: a pile of bloody boys’ bodies with flies buzzing all about them or a woman who lost her legs at the knees, lying in a cot, asking whether her daughter survived. But even during the film’s most stressful moments—including, most awkwardly, an emergency C-section in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night—“The Last Face” finds a way to wedge in a sense of romance. And a potential subplot involving Adele Exarchopoulos as a longtime aid worker whose history is entwined with both Wren’s and Miguel’s feels half-baked.\r\n\r\nUltimately, at the end of this overlong slog, “The Last Face” returns to the fancy fundraiser where it began. Wren tearfully tells the well-heeled crowd about refugees, “They are us,” and their dreams are as fundamental as breathing air. Then she strides off stage to the feel-good strains of “Peace Train.”\r\n\r\nIn this moment, Theron reminds us who she is: a glamorous movie star. It's one final, glaring example of the film's unfortunate penchant for style over substance.", date_published: "July 28, 2017", year: 2017, writer_id: 7, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/the-last-face.jpg").open}, excerpt: "'Sean Penn turns African strife into a two-hour perfume commercial with “The Last Face,”'", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/the-last-face.jpg").open},
  {title: "The Room", content: "Tommy Wiseau is not, technically, famous. He has never been on the cover of Us Weekly, nor has he been the subject of salacious rumors on E! — in short, he is the sort of person who can usually walk down the street without being stopped. Yet on a recent Friday night outside New York City's Ziegfeld Theatre, Wiseau was greeted by a mob of fans. They chanted his name, crowded around him for pictures and roped him into a game of catch. After he entered the theater, the people he left behind spoke in awestruck tones. Said one: \"This is the best night of my life.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowds were there for a midnight showing of Wiseau's unfathomably strange film The Room, to celebrate the anniversary of its inaugural New York City screening (Wiseau was talked out of his first choice for the location, Yankee Stadium) and to launch a national tour of the film.\r\n\r\nUnusually for a midnight-movie favorite, The Room contains no flesh-eating ghouls, no polygamous devil cults and no time-traveling transvestites. It is essentially a domestic drama, and the plot is simple: Johnny (Wiseau, who also wrote, directed and executive-produced) is dating Lisa (Juliette Danielle), who is cheating on him with his best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero). The actual film, though, is like a Koch snowflake of badness, wherein any scene has an infinite number of things wrong with it. Conversations start and stop and change topic at random, and the characters speak a strange brand of English that sounds like it has been filtered through three different Internet language translators. Major plot points are introduced — drug deals, underwear theft, breast cancer — and never dealt with again. There are languidly unerotic sex scenes, and interminable minutes devoted to the coffee orders of people standing in line in front of the main characters at Starbucks.\r\n\r\nBut The Room rises above garden-variety awful for a number of reasons, not least of them Wiseau himself. With his hulking physique, mane of black hair and vaguely Teutonic accent, Wiseau is jaw-droppingly miscast as a Regular Joe romantic lead. He looks like he should be playing a death-metal singer or a Viking warrior.\r\n\r\nThe film's backstory is just as mythically muddled. Rumors abound regarding its production, chief among them that Wiseau bankrolled the estimated $6 million production by importing leather jackets from Korea. (A distortion, he says: \"I designed an American leather jacket, and we imported it from Korea on my design.\") Asked to explain his age and background, Wiseau is less forthcoming. \"That has nothing to do with what I do,\" he says. \"My private life is my private life.\" In 2003, he booked The Room for two weeks at a Los Angeles theater, rented a billboard to advertise it on L.A.'s Highland Avenue and submitted it to the Academy Awards. Apart from a middling review in Variety, Hollywood paid little attention. But word was spreading of the film's unique appeal. After two weeks, Wiseau says, audiences were camping out outside the theater. Popularized by YouTube and name-dropped by famous fans (comedian David Cross and actress Kristen Bell both sing the film's praises), The Room has found devoted fans across the country. It has also shown in Canada, Australia and the U.K.\r\n\r\n\"It's just so ego-based and so melodramatic, like the strongest, most vulnerable thing you can imagine,\" says New Yorker George Gross, one of the organizers behind the Ziegfeld screening. \"It just collapses upon itself.\" Spellbound by the film after seeing it in October 2008, Gross and two friends acquired a print of The Room from Wiseau and screen it at Village East Cinema once a month to sellout crowds.\r\n\r\nNow that one man's poorly made vanity project has become a cult hit, it would be easy to paint the film as a sideshow attraction that exists only to be mocked. But Wiseau insists that The Room is deeper than its critics would suggest, full of layers of symbolism. (A question about the underwear subplot brings forth his ideas on privacy, respect and the way people treat their neighbors in Indiana.) Indeed, at least one screening attendee at the Ziegfeld has written a paper on The Room as ironic comedy. Most fans say they have genuine appreciation for the man and the film, and come to screenings not to bury Wiseau but praise him. \"It's a celebration,\" says Gross. \"Like, 'Here's one of my favorite jokes: Yay!' \"", date_published: "May 26, 2010", year: 2003, writer_id: 8, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/the-room.jpg").open}, excerpt: "'Conversations start and stop and change topic at random, and the characters speak a strange brand of English that sounds like it has been filtered through three different Internet language translators.'", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/the-room.jpg").open},
  {title: "Tim and Eric’s Billion Dollar Movie", content: "I feel I've failed Tim and Eric. They've gathered a cult following by doing comedy sketches that were deliberately bad, and now they've made a movie that is more of the same for 92 minutes, and it must have taken them a great deal of work to maintain their low standard. By not finding even one moment of \"Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie\" to be slightly funny, have I let down the side?\r\n\r\nThere is a scene in this film where a character is defecated on by several people at the same time, and I dunno … I didn't enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a cult is exclusion. If you're not in the cult, you are by definition lacking some essential quality shared by its members. Those inside the cult can feel privileged, even gifted, by their ability to Get It. I was willing to Get It, I was sincerely prepared, but at the end of this experience, I concluded there was nothing to be Got.\r\n\r\nThe premise is that Tim and Eric have been given $1 billion dollars to make a movie. This money has come from Tommy Schlaaang (Robert Loggia) and Earle Swinton (William Atherton), who run the Schlaaang Corp. The corporation is in violation of Ebert's Law of Funny Names, which teaches us that a name intended to be funny in a movie will almost certainly not be funny. Not everybody can come up with Rufus T. Firefly or Elmer Prettywilli, and if Tommy Schlaaang is the best Tim and Eric can do, they shouldn't have tried.\r\n\r\nTim and Eric blow the fortune by making a short subject, which they believed starred Johnny Depp. Swinton and Schlaaang perceive that it is not Johnny Depp but an imposter. Worse, the fake Johnny Depp (Ronnie Rodriguez) actually looks a little like Johnny Depp. Even a non-cult member like me knows that it would have been funnier if the Johnny Depp impersonator had been played by John C. Reilly, in character as Taquito, one of the most disturbed and disturbing characters I've seen in a while. To address Taquito as \"Snotnose\" would not be an insult but the simple truth.\r\n\r\nTaquito is a resident of the Swallow Valley Mall, where Tim and Eric hide out while on the run from the vengeful minions of the Schlaaang Corp. This mall is a dark and deserted place, inhabited by various failed lifeforms and certain actors (Jeff Goldblum, Will Ferrell) who in buying into Tim and Eric showed no better judgment than Swinton and Schlaaang.\r\n\r\nI can't keep this up. Describing the movie is bringing down the level of my prose. As faithful readers will know, I have a few cult followers who enjoy my reviews of bad movies. These have been collected in the books I Hated, Hated, Hated, HATED This Movie; Your Movie Sucks, and A Horrible Experience of Unendurable Length.

  {title: "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen", content: "\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" is a horrible experience of unbearable length, briefly punctuated by three or four amusing moments. One of these involves a dog-like robot humping the leg of the heroine. Such are the meager joys. If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination.\r\n\r\nThe plot is incomprehensible. The dialog of the Autobots®, Decepticons® and Otherbots® is meaningless word flap. Their accents are Brooklyese, British and hip-hop, as befits a race from the distant stars. Their appearance looks like junkyard throw-up. They are dumb as a rock. They share the film with human characters who are much more interesting, and that is very faint praise indeed.\r\n\r\nThe movie has been signed by Michael Bay. This is the same man who directed \"The Rock\" in  1996. Now he has made \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.\" Faust made a better deal. This isn't a film so much as a toy tie-in. Children holding a Transformer toy in their hand can invest it with wonder and magic, imagining it doing brave deeds and remaining always their friend. I knew a little boy once who lost his blue toy truck at the movies, and cried as if his heart would break. Such a child might regard \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" with fear and dismay.\r\n\r\nThe human actors are in a witless sitcom part of the time, and lot of the rest of their time is spent running in slo-mo away from explosions, although--hello!--you can't outrun an explosion. They also make speeches like this one by John Turturro: \"Oh, no! The machine is buried in the pyramid! If they turn it on, it will destroy the sun! Not on my watch!\" The humans, including lots of U.S. troops, shoot at the Transformers a lot, although never in the history of science fiction has an alien been harmed by gunfire.\r\n\r\nThere are many great-looking babes in the film, who are made up to a flawless perfection and look just like real women, if you are a junior fanboy whose experience of the gender is limited to lad magazines. The two most inexplicable characters are Ron and Judy Witwicky (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), who are the parents of Shia LaBeouf, who Mephistopheles threw in to sweeten the deal. They take their son away to Princeton, apparently a party school, where Judy eats some pot and goes berserk. Later they swoop down out of the sky on Egypt, for reasons the movie doesn't make crystal clear, so they also can run in slo-mo from explosions.\r\n\r\nThe battle scenes are bewildering. A Bot makes no visual sense anyway, but two or three tangled up together create an incomprehensible confusion. I find it amusing that creatures that can unfold out of a Camaro and stand four stories high do most of their fighting with...fists. Like I say, dumber than a box of staples. They have tiny little heads, although Jetfire® must be made of older models, since he has an aluminum beard.\r\n\r\nAware that this movie opened in England seven hours before Chicago time and the morning papers would be on the streets, after writing the above I looked up the first reviews as a reality check. I was reassured: \"Like watching paint dry while getting hit over the head with a frying pan!\" (Bradshaw, Guardian); \"Sums up everything that is most tedious, crass and despicable about modern Hollywood!\" (Tookey, Daily Mail); \"A giant, lumbering idiot of a movie!\" (Edwards, Daily Mirror). The first American review, Todd Gilchrist of Cinematical, reported that Bay's \"ambition runs a mile long and an inch deep,\" but, in a spirited defense, says \"this must be the most movie I have ever experienced.\" He is bullish on the box office: it \"feels destined to be the biggest movie of all time.\" It's certainly the biggest something of all time.", date_published: "June 23, 2009", year: 2009, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/transformers.jpg").open}, excerpt: "'\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" is a horrible experience of unbearable length, briefly punctuated by three or four amusing moments.

Granted some of them are more than 100 years old, but still: their charisma is by Madame Tussaud.\r\n\r\n\"The Twilight Saga: New Moon\" takes the tepid achievement of \"Twilight\" (2008), guts it, and leaves it for undead. You know you're in trouble with a sequel when the word of mouth advises you to see the first movie twice instead. Obviously the characters all have. Long opening stretches of this film make utterly no sense unless you walk in knowing the first film, and hopefully both Stephanie Meyer novels, by heart. Edward and Bella spend murky moments glowering at each other and thinking, So, here we are again.\r\n\r\nBella (Kristen Stewart) is still living at home with her divorced dad (Billy Burke), a cop whose disciplinary policy involves declaring her grounded for the rest of her life and then disappearing so she can jump from cliffs, haunt menacing forests, and fly to Italy so the movie can evoke the sad final death scene from--why, hold on, it's Romeo and Juliet! The very play Edward was reciting narcissistically and contemptuously in an opening scene.\r\n\r\nYes, Edward (Robert Pattinson) is back in school, repeating the 12th grade for the 84th time. Bella sees him in the school parking lot, walking toward her in slow-motion, wearing one of those Edwardian Beatles jackets with a velvet collar, pregnant with his beauty. How white his skin, how red his lips. The decay of middle age may transform him into the Joker.\r\n\r\nEdward and the other members of the Cullen vampire clan stand around a lot with glowering skulks. Long pauses interrupt longer ones. Listen up, lads! You may be immortal, but we've got a train to catch.\r\n\r\nEdward leaves, because Bella was not meant to be with him. Although he's a vegetarian vampire, when she gets a paper cut at her birthday party one of his pals leaps on her like a shark on a tuna fish.\r\n\r\nIn his absence she's befriended by Jake (Taylor Lautner), that nice American Indian boy. \"You've gotten all buff!\" she tells him. Yeah, real buff, and soon he's never wearing a shirt and standing outside in the winter rain as if he were--why, nothing more than a wild animal. They don't need coats like ours, remember, because God gave them theirs.\r\n\r\nThose not among that five percent of the movie's target audience that doesn't already know this will (spoiler) be surprised that Jake is a werewolf.\r\n\r\nBella: So…you're a werewolf? \r\nJake: Last time I checked. \r\nBella: \"Can't you find a way to...just stop? \r\nJake (patiently): \"It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.\"\r\n\r\nJake is influenced, or controlled, or something, by Sam, another member of the tribe. He's like the alpha wolf. Sam and his three friends are mostly seen in long shot, shirtless in the rain, hanging around the edges of the clearing as if hoping to dash in and pick off some fresh meat.\r\n\r\nBella writes long letters to her absent vampire friend Alice (Ashley Greene), in which she does nothing to explain why she is helplessly attracted to these sinister, humorless and vain men. It can't be the sex. As I've already explained in my review of the first film, The Twilight Saga is an extended metaphor for teen chastity, in which the punishment for being deflowered I will leave to your imagination.\r\n\r\nThe movie includes beauteous fields filled with potted flowers apparently buried hours before by the grounds crew, and nobody not clued in on the plot.

  {title: "Jack & Jill", content: "Adam Sandler has succumbed to the Eddie Murphy syndrome. He's afflicted with the belief that we can't get enough of him.\r\n\r\nThe chief symptom is an urge to play multiple roles. In Jack and Jill, he has cast himself as twins. Jack, a wealthy advertising man with a beautiful wife, two children and a big house in Los Angeles, is the one liked by everybody. Jill is the social misfit. She lives in the Bronx, has a voice like a power drill and she has been entrusted with all the movie's fart jokes, which are noisy and noisome, as well as ubiquitous. I keep waiting for American comics to get over their realisation that there are certain bodily functions that can make human beings feel silly but it doesn't happen. At 45, Sandler can definitely be called middle-aged but he's still hooked on the frat boy humour that has been fuelling his movies for the past 15 years.\r\n\r\nMore mysteriously, he manages to persuade all sorts of big names to join him in the messes he makes. Admittedly, they're lucrative messes but it's depressing to speculate that money alone could have accounted for the presence of Johnny Depp here in a cameo part. On second thoughts, it's even more depressing to think that he has offered his services for next to nothing because he views this stuff as being funny.\r\n\r\nUnless she's desperate for a change in her domestic scenery, I can't begin to imagine why Katie Holmes would have said yes to the role of Jack's ever-compliant wife.\r\n\r\nFinally, what's Al Pacino doing here, playing a demented version of himself? He's supposed to have suffered a nervous breakdown while performing Richard III onstage - a fact which hasn't stopped Jack's main client, Dunkin' Donuts, from demanding that Jack snare him for their next round of commercials. Yes, blatant product placement is another of the film's sins.\r\n\r\nDirected by Sandler's regular collaborator, Dennis Dugan, it also has Jack and family taking a Caribbean cruise aboard a giant liner which happened to be launched when the film was being shot. The shipboard scenes do nothing to enhance the storyline or its schedule of pratfalls. It just looks as if director, cast and crew fancied a few days afloat.\r\n\r\nNot that there's much energy invested in the plot. It revolves around Jill's Thanksgiving visit to Jack and his family and the way it extends into the New Year, despite Jack's protests. She adores him but he can't bear to be in her company, possibly because Sandler has thought up so many ways of making her obnoxious.\r\n\r\nWhen Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams ventured into drag for Tootsie and Mrs Doubtfire, they came up with rather sweet-natured creations but Sandler has gone for unadulterated crassness. It's not a comic turn. It's an exercise in misogyny with as many grotesque flourishes as he can pack into Jill's ample frame.\r\n\r\nHis style has always seemed fairly cold-blooded to me. His best performance was in Funny People (2009), Judd Apatow's acutely observed portrait of an acerbic comedian who jettisons so many friends and lovers on his way to the top that the only person interested in the fact that he has been diagnosed with a fatal disease is his agent.\r\n\r\nIt came after Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love (2002) and Mike Binder's Reign Over Me (2007) - two other films that explored Sandler's snarky-cum-serious side - and it suggested that he could be considering a change of direction. But, no, the idiocy goes on - and on.\r\n\r\nThis one is also mean-spirited - until the end when we're asked to believe that Jill is truly lovable, if a little misunderstood.

  {title: "Wanted", content: "You could gargle bitumen and bin-juice for half an hour, and it couldn't leave a nastier taste in your mouth than this macho action thriller about a secret fraternity of assassins. It is directed by Timur Bekmambetov, evidently brought over to Hollywood on the strength of his wildly successful Russian movies like Day Watch. The stars are Angelina Jolie, sporting her now familiar default smirk, and our own James McAvoy stepping up to his first A-list role. The spectacle of their strange gym-built bodies, variously starved and pumped, and the boring, risk-free digital \"stunts\", can't distract you from just how dreary and insidious the whole business is. It looks as if it has been written by a committee of 13-year-old boys for whom penetrative sex is still only a rumour, and the resulting movie plays like a party political broadcast on behalf of the misogynist party.\r\n\r\nJames McAvoy plays Wes, an ordinary nerdy guy who has an office job which totally sucks. He's pathetic, a loser, on medication for anxiety attacks, of all the spurious and ridiculous ailments. His best friend is a bullying jock who is boning Wes's whiney and nagging girlfriend on the sly, and incidentally adding insult to injury by mooching cash off Wes for the necessary contraceptive materials. But Wes's untermensch life is turned around when Angelina Jolie pops up out of nowhere in a drugstore, saves Wes from a mysterious, spectacular attempt on his life, and shoves the gibbering soon-to-be-ex-nerd into her flashy automobile for a crash-bang chase along the city freeway, exchanging fire with the gunman.\r\n\r\nWes is evidently hated by the forces of darkness because, quite without knowing it, he is a ninja of topping people; his own father, a master assassin whom he never knew, has just been killed by the shadowy opposition. It is his fate to be a master killer, and it is the job of Jolie - known simply as \"Fox\" -to force him to step up, to accept his destiny and enter the Fraternity, a secret society of bespoke killers dedicated to taking out important bad guys. The Fraternity hides out inside what looks like a castle modelled on Balmoral, disguised as a community of weavers.\r\n\r\nTheir super-sexy way of shooting people - apart, obviously, from the usual technique of doing it with outstretched arm, gun tilted 90 degrees, face insouciantly pointing away from the victim - is to use a special bullet with corkscrew grooving. This, and a slight whiplash with the shooting arm, will cause the bullet to curve round corners, a setpiece which perhaps shows the influence of David Beckham. Wes of course blossoms into an alpha-male, and even gets some liplock action with Angelina, which looks like he's snogging a singed sofa.\r\n\r\nWeirdly, though, it is Wes's pre-heroic life which is given the most passion by Bekmambetov. None of the violence and the action have a fraction of the beady-eyed intensity with which the director invests the moment where Wes quits his job and tells his boss to shove it. Because his boss is a fat ugly woman. This horrible bitch is always snapping at him and she gets her comeuppance in a big way, her obesity being a clear sign that she's asking to be brought low and laughed at. Her existence is briefly reprised at the end of the film, when one of Wes's bullets whistles through the doughnut she's gobbling.\r\n\r\nI have to say I don't think I've seen a film recently which expresses hatred of women quite so openly, and fervently, as this one. In a way, Wes's boss is the most vivid female character in the film, more powerfully and pointedly conceived than the others: more than Wes's horrible, duplicitous girlfriend, who gets to be humiliated by seeing Wes kissing Fox and more than Fox herself, who is basically an honorary male. This is a film where womankind is represented by irrelevant sleek babes and obese comic foils, an ugly whorehouse aesthetic which really does sock over its contempt for femaleness very, very powerfully indeed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's absurd to worry in these terms about a silly, disposable movie like this. And yet I can't help thinking that if a film treated any ethnic group the way this treats women, it would find itself in pretty hot water. And it's sad to see Angelina Jolie, a performer with style - who moreover did the assassin role with considerably more wit and charm in Mr and Mrs Smith - trundled out for this piffle. It's also sad to see James McAvoy offer an IQ-discount in a similar way. In an ideal world, the title would have the word \"Not\" tacked on to the front.", date_published: "June 25, 2008", year: 2008, writer_id: 3, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/wanted.jpg").open, excerpt: "'You could gargle bitumen and bin-juice for half an hour, and it couldn't leave a nastier taste in your mouth than this macho action thriller about a secret fraternity of assassins.'", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/wanted.jpg").open},
  {title: "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigalo", content: "\"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\" makes a living cleaning fish tanks and occasionally prostituting himself. How much he charges I'm not sure, but the price is worth it if it keeps him off the streets and out of another movie. \"Deuce Bigalow\" is aggressively bad, as if it wants to cause suffering to the audience. The best thing about it is that it runs for only 75 minutes.\r\n\r\nRob Schneider is back, playing a male prostitute (or, as the movie reminds us dozens of times, a \"man whore\"). He is not a gay hustler, but specializes in pleasuring women, although the movie's closest thing to a sex scene is when he wears diapers on orders from a giantess. Oh, and he goes to dinner with a woman with a laryngectomy, who sprays wine on him through her neck vent.\r\n\r\nThe plot: Deuce visits his friend T.J. Hicks (Eddie Griffin) in Amsterdam, where T.J. is a pimp specializing in man-whores. Business is bad, because a serial killer is murdering male prostitutes, and so Deuce acts as a decoy to entrap the killer. In his investigation he encounters a woman with a penis for a nose. You don't want to know what happens when she sneezes.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound like a movie you want to see? It sounds to me like a movie that Columbia Pictures and the film's producers (Glenn S. Gainor, Jack Giarraputo, Tom McNulty, Nathan Talbert Reimann, Adam Sandler and John Schneider) should be discussing in long, sad conversations with their inner child.\r\n\r\nThe movie created a spot of controversy last February. According to a story by Larry Carroll of MTV News, Rob Schneider took offense when Patrick Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times listed this year's Best Picture Nominees and wrote that they were \"ignored, unloved and turned down flat by most of the same studios that ... bankroll hundreds of sequels, including a follow-up to 'Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,' a film that was sadly overlooked at Oscar time because apparently nobody had the foresight to invent a category for Best Running Penis Joke Delivered by a Third-Rate Comic.\"\r\n\r\nSchneider retaliated by attacking Goldstein in full-page ads in Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. In an open letter to Goldstein, Schneider wrote: \"Well, Mr. Goldstein, I decided to do some research to find out what awards you have won. I went online and found that you have won nothing. Absolutely nothing. No journalistic awards of any kind ... Maybe you didn't win a Pulitzer Prize because they haven't invented a category for Best Third-Rate, Unfunny Pompous Reporter Who's Never Been Acknowledged by His Peers.\"\r\n\r\nReading this, I was about to observe that Schneider can dish it out but he can't take it. Then I found he's not so good at dishing it out, either. I went online and found that Patrick Goldstein has won a National Headliner Award, a Los Angeles Press Club Award, a RockCritics.com award, and the Publicists' Guild award for lifetime achievement.\r\n\r\nSchneider was nominated for a 2000 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor, but lost to Jar-Jar Binks.\r\n\r\nBut Schneider is correct, and Patrick Goldstein has not yet won a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, Goldstein is not qualified to complain that Columbia financed \"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\" while passing on the opportunity to participate in \"Million Dollar Baby,\" \"Ray,\" \"The Aviator,\" \"Sideways\" and \"Finding Neverland.\" As chance would have it, I have won the Pulitzer Prize, and so I am qualified.

There they go again. Bringing us a movie based, with chilling calculation, on a hit stage show franchise, this one being laboriously structured around the songs of the once mocked, then ironised and now adored 70s pop legends Abba. The most transcendent type of film, they say, leaves a subliminal image imprinted on your mental retina, an image which you only see fully on leaving the cinema. After Michael Haneke's Hidden, we asked ourselves: \"So what did happen outside the school gates?\" Ten minutes after this film, I suddenly gasped: \"Ohmigod, was Colin Firth's character supposed to be gay?\" Of this, more in a moment.\r\n\r\nStruldbruggs among you will remember the 1994 film Muriel's Wedding, with Toni Collette as the big, goofy woman who is obsessed with Abba and dreams about a white wedding. (That ecstatic-bride logo for the Mamma Mia! stage show, on display outside theatres from Antwerp to Las Vegas, owes a great deal to the Muriel's Wedding poster.) Muriel's Wedding was however conceived during the affectionate-irony phase of Abba's reputation, when it was entirely appropriate that a nerd should be obsessed by the band, but that the nerd should be gloriously empowered and transformed by the sheer zinging power of Abba's tunes.\r\n\r\nMamma Mia! The Movie is very different. Everything has been squeaky-cleaned up. It too has a feelgood wedding motif - but there is no irony, no heartache, certainly no paralysing illness, no dramatic plausibility, and weirdly, no hint that the characters know whose songs they are singing; there is no sense of perspective on the music. In Mamma Mia! Abba is everywhere and nowhere. This is Planet Abba or Abbaworld. The characters are forever dancing and smiling and bursting into Abba songs like Stepford cyborgs when you flip the secret panel behind their heads and press the Life-Affirming Behaviour button. An Abba instrumental is even used when the bride walks up the aisle, instead of Handel. And nobody ever says: \"Oh for Gawd's sake, just for a change, can we sing something by the Carpenters?\"\r\n\r\nThe story is ... urh. No film has ever had a more irrelevant story. Is it, you ask, a musical account of the true story of how Abba singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad was born in 1945 as a result of a Nazi plan to boost the Aryan gene pool by mating German soldiers with Norwegian mothers? No. The film and stage show are very loosely based on a 1968 Gina Lollobrigida movie called Buona Sera, Mrs Campbell. Meryl Streep plays Donna, a former hippie and free spirit who runs a B&B on a horrendous Shirley-Valentine-style Greek island. Her 20-year-old daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfield) is about to get married. Donna has invited her best buddies Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) to the event. But how about Sophie's long-lost father, the guy who had his way with Donna and scarpered all those years ago? Sophie has life-affirmingly discovered the existence of three of her multi-shagging mum's old lovers who may have supplied the DNA at the time. Life-affirmingly, she invites them all to her wedding without telling her mother: Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Bill (Stellan Skarsgård) and Harry (Colin Firth). All three guys show up with cute old photos of them in hippy-ish or punky garb. Bill even waffles about his love for Donna having taken place in the era of peace and love. Huh? Assuming the film is set roughly in the present day, and Sophie is 20, then their love was in the era of Westland and privatising British Gas.\r\n\r\nAnyway, all three guys are still plausibly dishy. But there is something odd about Colin Firth. Of the three, his paternity claim appears to be the weakest; he talks about having no children, only a pair of dogs, and in the final group-dance-hug scene, appears to cop off with someone of the same genital group. Could it be that Colin's enthusiasm for womankind is now limited to his mamma-mia? Is this the movie attempting, in its simperingly inclusive way, to acknowledge the band's gay fanbase? Either way, it's a coy sort of outing which leaves the character deeper in the closet than ever.\r\n\r\nMamma Mia! ties itself in knots trying to shoehorn in every single famous number, and each time, the beginning of an Abba song triggered in me a Pavlovian stab of pleasure, cancelled after a millionth of a second by a backwash of rage that this soulless panto has done nothing to earn or even understand the good feeling.\r\n\r\nSome songs are easier to incorporate than others. Waterloo is saved for the closing credits, perhaps because screenwriter Catherine Johnson didn't grasp its metaphorical quality, and that she would not in fact need a vast Napoleonic army to troop across the island. But there is one very famous Abba number which is entirely omitted. That is a crying shame. I have an idea for the way in which it could yet be included, should an extra scene be needed for the DVD. There's a six-year-old boy on the island called Fernando, and caring Meryl Streep suspects that poor little Fernando could be hearing-impaired. She sits the little lad down, takes out a set of drums and bangs them close to his ears; with tears pouring down her cheeks, she sings to him a single, heart-rending question ...", date_published: "July 10, 2008", year: 2008, writer_id: 3, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/mamma-mia-movie.jpg").open, excerpt: "'I've been cheated by films since I don't know whe-e-n, Ta-da-da-da-da; ta-da-da-da-da.

  {title: "Battlefield Earth", content: "\"Battlefield Earth\" is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way. The visuals are grubby and drab. The characters are unkempt and have rotten teeth. Breathing tubes hang from their noses like ropes of snot. The soundtrack sounds like the boom mike is being slammed against the inside of a 55-gallon drum. The plot. . . .\r\n\r\nBut let me catch my breath. This movie is awful in so many different ways. Even the opening titles are cheesy. Sci-fi epics usually begin with a stab at impressive titles, but this one just displays green letters on the screen in a type font that came with my Macintosh. Then the movie's subtitle unscrolls from left to right in the kind of \"effect\" you see in home movies.\r\n\r\nIt is the year 3000. The race of Psychlos has conquered the earth. Humans survive in scattered bands, living like actors auditioning for the sequel to \"Quest for Fire.\" Soon they leave the wilderness and prowl through the ruins of theme parks and the city of Denver. The ruins have held up well after 1,000 years. (Library books are dusty but readable, and a flight simulator still works, although where it gets the electricity is a mystery.) The hero, named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, is played by Barry Pepper as a smart human who gets smarter, thanks to a Pyschlo gizmo that zaps his eyeballs with knowledge. He learns Euclidean geometry and how to fly a jet, and proves to be a quick learner for a caveman. The villains are two Psychlos named Terl (John Travolta) and Ker (Forest Whitaker). Terl is head of security for the Psychlos and has a secret scheme to use the humans as slaves to mine gold for him. He can't be reported to his superiors because (I am not making this up) he can blackmail his enemies with secret recordings that, in the event of his death, \"would go straight to the home office!\" Letterman fans laugh at that line; did the filmmakers know it was funny? Jonnie Goodboy figures out a way to avoid slave labor in the gold mines. He and his men simply go to Fort Knox, break in and steal gold. Of course it's been waiting there for 1,000 years. What Terl says when his slaves hand him smelted bars of gold is beyond explanation. For stunning displays of stupidity, Terl takes the cake; as chief of security for the conquering aliens, he doesn't even know what humans eat, and devises an experiment: \"Let it think it has escaped! We can sit back and watch it choose its food.\" Bad luck for the starving humans that they capture a rat. An experiment like that, you pray for a chicken.\r\n\r\nHiring Travolta and Whitaker was a waste of money, since we can't recognize them behind pounds of matted hair and gnarly makeup. Their costumes look like they were purchased from the Goodwill store on the planet Tatooine. Travolta can be charming, funny, touching and brave in his best roles; why disguise him as a smelly alien creep? The Psychlos can fly between galaxies, but look at their nails: Their civilization has mastered the hyperdrive but not the manicure.\r\n\r\nI am not against unclean characters on principle--at least now that the threat of Smell-O-Vision no longer hangs over our heads. Lots of great movies have squalid heroes. But when the characters seem noxious on principle, we wonder if the art and costume departments were allowed to run wild.\r\n\r\n\"Battlefield Earth\" was written in 1980 by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. The film contains no evidence of Scientology or any other system of thought; it is shapeless and senseless, without a compelling plot or characters we care for in the slightest. The director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why.\r\n\r\nSome movies run off the rails. This one is like the train crash in \"The Fugitive.\" I watched it in mounting gloom, realizing I was witnessing something historic, a film that for decades to come will be the punch line of jokes about bad movies. There is a moment here when the Psychlos' entire planet (home office and all) is blown to smithereens, without the slightest impact on any member of the audience (or, for that matter, the cast).
