  {name: "Roger Ebert", publication: "Chicago Sun-Times", bio: "Roger Joseph Ebert (June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.\r\n\r\nEbert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews, followed by several variously named At the Movies programs. The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase \"Two Thumbs Up,\" used when both hosts gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper.\r\n\r\nNeil Steinberg of the Chicago Sun-Times said Ebert \"was without question the nation's most prominent and influential film critic\", Tom Van Riper of Forbes described him as \"the most powerful pundit in America\", and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called him \"the best-known film critic in America\".\r\n\r\nEbert lived with cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands from 2002. This required treatments necessitating the removal of his lower jaw, which cost him the ability to speak or eat normally. His ability to write remained unimpaired, however, and he continued to publish frequently both online and in print until his death on April 4, 2013."},

  {title: "Armageddon", content: "Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. \"Armageddon\" is cut together like its own highlights. Take almost any 30 seconds at random, and you'd have a TV ad. The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained. No matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out.\r\n\r\nThe plot covers many of the same bases as the recent \"Deep Impact,\" which, compared with \"Armageddon,\" belongs on the American Film Institute list. The movie tells a similar story at fast-forward speed, with Bruce Willis as an oil driller who is recruited to lead two teams on an emergency shuttle mission to an asteroid \"the size of Texas,\" which is about to crash into Earth and obliterate all life--\"even viruses!\" Their job: Drill an 800-foot hole and stuff a bomb into it, to blow up the asteroid before it kills us.\r\n\r\nOK, say you do succeed in blowing up an asteroid the size of Texas. What if a piece the size of Dallas is left? Wouldn't that be big enough to destroy life on Earth? What about a piece the size of Austin? Let's face it: Even an object the size of that big Wal-Mart outside Abilene would pretty much clean us out, if you count the parking lot.\r\n\r\nTexas is a big state, but as a celestial object, it wouldn't be able to generate much gravity. Yet when the astronauts get to the asteroid, they walk around on it as if the gravity is the same as on Earth. There's no sensation of weightlessness--until it's needed, that is, and then a lunar buggy flies across a jagged canyon, Evel Knievel-style.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins with a Charlton Heston narration telling us about the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. Then we get the masterful title card, \"65 Million Years Later.\" The next scenes show an amateur astronomer spotting the object. We see top-level meetings at the Pentagon and in the White House. We meet Billy Bob Thornton, head of Mission Control in Houston, which apparently functions like a sports bar with a big screen for the fans, but no booze. Then we see ordinary people whose lives will be Changed Forever by the events to come. This stuff is all off the shelf--there's hardly an original idea in the movie.\r\n\r\n\"Armageddon\" reportedly used the services of nine writers. Why did it need any? The dialogue is either shouted one-liners or romantic drivel. \"It's gonna blow!\" is used so many times, I wonder if every single writer used it once, and then sat back from his word processor with a contented smile on his face, another day's work done.\r\n\r\nDisaster movies always have little vignettes of everyday life. The dumbest in \"Armageddon\" involves two Japanese tourists in a New York taxi. After meteors turn an entire street into a flaming wasteland, the woman complains, \"I want to go shopping!\" I hope in Japan that line is redubbed as \"Nothing can save us but Gamera!\" Meanwhile, we wade through a romantic subplot involving Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck. Liv plays Bruce Willis' daughter. Ben is Willis' best driller (now, now). Bruce finds Liv in Ben's bunk on an oil platform and chases Ben all over the rig, trying to shoot him. (You would think the crew would be preoccupied by the semi-destruction of Manhattan, but it's never mentioned after it happens.) Helicopters arrive to take Willis to the mainland so he can head up the mission to save mankind, etc., and he insists on using only crews from his own rig--especially Affleck, who is \"like a son.\" That means Liv and Ben have a heart-rending parting scene. What is it about cinematographers and Liv Tyler? She is a beautiful young woman, but she's always being photographed while flat on her back, with her brassiere riding up around her chin and lots of wrinkles in her neck from trying to see what some guy is doing. (In this case, Affleck is tickling her navel with animal crackers.) Tyler is obviously a beneficiary of Take Your Daughter to Work Day. She's not only on the oil rig, but she attends training sessions with her dad and her boyfriend, hangs out in Mission Control and walks onto landing strips right next to guys wearing foil suits.\r\n\r\nCharacters in this movie actually say: \"I wanted to say ... that I'm sorry,\" \"We're not leaving them behind!,\" \"Guys--the clock is ticking!\" and \"This has turned into a surrealistic nightmare!\" Steve Buscemi, a crew member who is diagnosed with \"space dementia,\" looks at the asteroid's surface and adds \"This place is like Dr. Seuss' worst nightmare.\" Quick--which Seuss book is he thinking of? There are several Red Digital Readout scenes, in which bombs tick down to zero. Do bomb designers do that for the convenience of interested onlookers who happen to be standing next to a bomb? There's even a retread of the classic scene where they're trying to disconnect the timer, and they have to decide whether to cut the red wire or the blue wire. The movie has forgotten that *this is not a terrorist bomb,* but a standard-issue U.S. military bomb, being defused by a military guy who is on board specifically because he knows about this bomb. A guy like that, the first thing he should know is, red or blue? \"Armageddon\" is loud, ugly and fragmented. Action sequences are cut together at bewildering speed out of hundreds of short edits, so that we can't see for sure what's happening, or how, or why. Important special-effects shots (such as the asteroid) have a murkiness of detail, and the movie cuts away before we get a good look. The few \"dramatic\" scenes consist of the sonorous recitation of ancient cliches. Only near the end, when every second counts, does the movie slow down: Life on Earth is about to end, but the hero delays saving the planet in order to recite cornball farewell platitudes.\r\n\r\nStaggering into the silence of the theater lobby after the ordeal was over, I found a big poster that was fresh off the presses with the quotes of junket blurbsters. \"It will obliterate your senses!\" reports David Gillin, who obviously writes autobiographically. \"It will suck the air right out of your lungs!\" vows Diane Kaminsky.\r\n\r\nIf it does, consider it a mercy killing.", date_published: "July 1, 1998", year: 1998, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/armageddon.jpg").open, excerpt: "The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/armageddon.jpg").open},
  {title: "Body of Evidence", content: "I've seen comedies with fewer laughs than \"Body of Evidence,\" and this is a movie that isn't even trying to be funny. It's an excruciatingly incompetent entry in the \"Basic Instinct\" genre, filled with lines that only a screenwriter could love, and burdened with a plot that confuses mystery with confusion.\r\n\r\nThe movie stars Madonna, who after \"Bloodhounds of Broadway,\" \"Shanghai Surprise\" and \"Who's That Girl?\" now nails down her title as the queen of movies that were bad ideas right from the beginning. She plays a kinky dominatrix involved in ingenious and hazardous sex with an aging millionaire who has a bad heart. He dies after an evening's entertainment, and Madonna is charged with his murder.\r\n\r\nBut she's innocent, she protests - and indeed there is another obvious suspect, the millionaire's private secretary (Anne Archer), who is also his spurned former lover. Willem Dafoe plays the defense attorney who firmly believes Madonna is innocent, or in any event very sexy, and Joe Mantegna has the Hamilton Burger role.\r\n\r\nThe movie takes place in Portland, Ore. - a city small enough, Madonna volunteers from the witness stand, that she once dated a guy who dated a girl who dated Mantegna. That's a typical exchange in the courtroom scenes, which involve Dafoe being reprimanded by the judge for just about every breath he draws.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether to blame the director, the cinematographer or the editor for some of the inept choices in this movie. One example: Dafoe is addressing his opening remarks to the jury, and the camera pulls focus so that we see an attractive young female juror sitting in the front row. She gives Dafoe an unmistakable look. We in the audience are alerted that the movie is establishing her for a later payoff. We're wrong. She's just an extra trying to grab some extra business.\r\n\r\nBut enough on the technical side. What about the story here? It has to be seen to be believed - something I do not advise. There's all kinds of murky plot debris involving nasal spray with cocaine in it, ghosts from the past, bizarre sex, and lots of nudity. We are asked to believe that Madonna lives on a luxury houseboat, where she parades in front of the windows naked at all hours, yet somehow doesn't attract a crowd, not even of appreciative lobstermen. What does she dedicate her life to? She answers that question in one of the movie's funniest lines, which unfortunately cannot be printed here.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to eroticism, \"Body of Evidence\" is like Madonna's new book. It knows the words but not the music. All of the paraphernalia and lore of S & M sexuality are here, but none of the passion or even enjoyment. We are told by one witness that sex with the Madonna character is intense. It turns out later he's not a very reliable witness.", date_published: "January 15, 1993", year: 1993, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/body-of-evidence.jpg").open, excerpt: "Madonna lives on a luxury houseboat, where she parades in front of the windows naked at all hours, yet somehow doesn't attract a crowd, not even of appreciative lobstermen", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/body-of-evidence.jpg").open},
  {title: "Pearl Harbor", content: "\"Pearl Harbor\" is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle. Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality. The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialog, it will not be because you admire them.\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers seem to have aimed the film at an audience that may not have heard of Pearl Harbor, or perhaps even of World War Two. This is the Our Weekly Reader version. If you have the slightest knowledge of the events in the film, you will know more than it can tell you. There is no sense of history, strategy or context; according to this movie, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut off its oil supply, and they were down to an 18 month reserve. Would going to war restore the fuel sources? Did they perhaps also have imperialist designs? Movie doesn't say.\r\n\r\nSo shaky is the film's history that at the end, when Jimmy Doolittle's Tokyo raiders crash-land in China, they're shot at by Japanese patrols with only a murky throwaway explanation about the Sino-Japanese war already underway. I predict some viewers will leave the theater sincerely confused about why there were Japanese in China.\r\n\r\nAs for the movie's portrait of the Japanese themselves, it is so oblique that Japanese audiences will find little to complain about apart from the fact that they play such a small role in their own raid. There are several scenes where the Japanese high command debates military tactics, but all of their dialog is strictly expository; they state facts but do not emerge with personalities or passions. Only Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) is seen as an individual, and his dialog seems to have been singled out with the hindsight of history. Congratulated on a brilliant raid, he demurs, \"A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.\" And later, \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.\" Do you imagine at any point the Japanese high command engaged in the 1941 Japanese equivalent of exchanging high-fives and shouting \"Yes!\" while pumping their fists in the air? Not in this movie, where the Japanese seem to have been melancholy even at the time about the regrettable need to play such a negative role in such a positive Hollywood film.\r\n\r\nThe American side of the story centers on two childhood friends from Tennessee with the standard-issue screenplay names Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). They enter the Army Air Corps and both fall in love with the same nurse, Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale)--first Rafe falls for her, and then, after he is reported dead, Danny. Their first date is subtitled \"Three Months Later\" and ends with Danny, having apparently read the subtitle, telling Evelyn, \"Don't let it be three months before I see you again, okay?\" That gets almost as big a laugh as her line to Rafe, \"I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you.\" That kind of bad laugh would have been sidestepped in a more literate screenplay, but our hopes are not high after an early newsreel report that the Germans are bombing \"downtown London\"--a difficult target, since although there is such a place as \"central London,\" at no time in 2,000 years has London ever had anything described by anybody as a \"downtown.\" There is not a shred of conviction or chemistry in the love triangle, which results after Rafe returns alive to Hawaii shortly before the raid on Pearl Harbor and is angry at Evelyn for falling in love with Danny, inspiring her timeless line, \"I didn't even know until the day you turned up alive--and then all this happened.\" Evelyn is a hero in the aftermath of the raid, performing triage by using her lipstick to separate the wounded who should be treated from those left to die. In a pointless stylistic choice, director Michael Bay and cinematographer John Schwartzman shoot some of the hospital scenes in soft focus, some in sharp focus, some blurred. Why? I understand it's to obscure details deemed too gory for the PG-13 rating. (Why should the carnage at Pearl Harbor be toned down to PG-13 in the first place?) In the newsreel sequences, the movie fades in and out of black and white with almost amusing haste, while the newsreel announcer sounds not like a period voice but like a Top-40 deejay in an echo chamber.\r\n\r\nThe most involving material in the film comes at the end, when Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) leads his famous raid on Tokyo, flying Army bombers off the decks of Navy carriers and hoping to crash-land in China.\r\n\r\nHe and his men were heroes, and their story would make a good movie (and indeed has: \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\"). Another hero in the movie is the African-American cook Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who because of his race was not allowed to touch a gun in the racist pre-war Navy, but opens fire during the raid, shoots down two planes, and saves the life of his captain. He's shown getting a medal. Nice to see an African-American in the movie, but the almost total absence of Asians in 1941 Hawaii is inexplicable.\r\n\r\nAs for the raid itself, a little goes a long way. What is the point, really, of more than half an hour of planes bombing ships, of explosions and fireballs, of roars on the soundtrack and bodies flying through the air and people running away from fighters that are strafing them? How can it be entertaining or moving when it's simply about the most appalling slaughter? Why do the filmmakers think we want to see this, unrelieved by intelligence, viewpoint or insight? It was a terrible, terrible day. Three thousand died in all. This is not a movie about them.\r\n\r\nIt is an unremarkable action movie; Pearl Harbor supplies the subject, but not the inspiration.", date_published: "May 25, 2001", year: 2001, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/pearl-harbor-poster.jpg").open, excerpt: "\"Pearl Harbor\" is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle.", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/pearl-harbor-banner.jpg").open},
  {title: "Catwoman", content: "\"Catwoman\" is a movie about Halle Berry's beauty, sex appeal, figure, eyes, lips and costume design. It gets those right. Everything else is secondary, except for the plot, which is tertiary. What a letdown. The filmmakers have given great thought to photographing Berry, who looks fabulous, and little thought to providing her with a strong character, story, supporting characters or action sequences. In a summer when \"Spider-Man 2\" represents the state of the art, \"Catwoman\" is tired and dated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the movie's faults are many, the crucial one is that we never get any sense of what it feels like to turn into a catwoman. The strength of \"Spider-Man 2\" is in the ambivalence that Peter Parker has about being part nerdy student, part superhero. In \"Catwoman,\" where are the scenes where a woman comes to grip with the fact that her entire nature and even her species seems to have changed?\r\n\r\nBerry plays Patience Phillips, a designer for an ad agency, who dies and is reborn after Midnight, a cat with ties to ancient Egypt, breathes new life into her. She becomes Catwoman, but what is a catwoman? She can leap like a cat, strut around on top of her furniture, survive great falls and hiss. Berry looks great doing these things, and spends a lot of time on all fours, inspiring our almost unseemly gratitude for her cleavage.\r\n\r\nShe gobbles down tuna and sushi. Her eyes have vertical pupils instead of round ones. She sleeps on a shelf. The movie doesn't get into the litter box situation. What does she think about all of this? Why isn't she more astonished that it has happened to her? How does it affect her relationship with that cute cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt)?\r\n\r\nThe movie makes it clear that they make love at least once, but we don't see that happening because \"Catwoman,\" a film that was born to be rated R, has been squeezed into the PG-13 category to rake in every last teenage dollar. From what we know about Catwoman, her style in bed has probably changed along with everything else, and sure enough, the next day he notices a claw mark on his shoulder. Given the MPAA's preference for violence over sex, this might have been one sex scene that could have sneaked in under the PG-13.\r\n\r\nCatwoman dresses like a dominatrix, with the high heels and the leather skirt, brassiere, mask and whip. But why? Because the costume sketches looked great, is my opinion. The film gives her a plot that could have been phoned in from the 1960s: She works for a corporation that's introducing a new beauty product that gives women eternal youth, unless they stop taking it, in which case they look like burn victims. When Patience stumbles over this unfortunate side effect, she is attacked by security guards, flushed out of a waste pipe and is dead when Midnight finds her.\r\n\r\nSoon she has a dual identity: Patience by day, Catwoman by night. She already knows Tom Lone. They met when she crawled out of her window and balanced on an air conditioner to rescue Midnight, and Tom thought she was committing suicide and saved her after she slipped. Uh, huh. That meeting begins a romance between Patience and Tom that is remarkable for its complete lack of energy, passion and chemistry. If the movie had been 10 minutes longer, it would have needed a scene where they sigh and sadly agree their relationship is just not working out. One of those things. Not meant to be.\r\n\r\nThe villains are Laurel and Georges Hedare (Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson). He runs the cosmetics company and fires his wife as its model when she turns 40. She is not to be trifled with, especially not in a movie where the big fight scene is a real catfight, so to speak, between the two women. Stone's character is laughably one-dimensional, but then that's a good fit for this movie, in which none of the characters suggest any human dimensions and seem to be posing more than relating. Take Georges, for example, whose obnoxious mannerisms are so grotesque he's like the \"Saturday Night Live\" version of Vincent Price.\r\n\r\nAmong many silly scenes, the silliest has to be the Ferris wheel sequence, which isn't even as thrilling as the one in \"The Notebook.\" Wouldn't you just know that after the wheel stalls, the operator would recklessly strip the gears, and the little boy riding alone would be in a chair where the guard rail falls off, and then the seat comes loose, and then the wheel tries to shake him loose and no doubt would try to electrocute him if it could.\r\n\r\nThe score by Klaus Badelt is particularly annoying; it faithfully mirrors every action, with what occasionally sounds like a karoke rhythm section. The director, whose name is Pitof, was probably issued with two names at birth and would be wise to use the other one on his next project.\r\n\r\n", date_published: "July 19, 2004", year: 2004, writer_id: 1, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/catwoman.jpg").open, excerpt: "The director, whose name is Pitof, was probably issued with two names at birth and would be wise to use the other one on his next project.", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/catwoman.jpg").open},
  {title: "Sex and the City 2", content: "Morecambe and Wise did it. Del and Rodney Trotter did it. Even On the Buses went to Wales. When a television show, no matter how popular, is getting a bit tired, its makers tend to ring up the local travel agent, and set about transplanting its cast and crew for jolly japes in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nNow it’s happened in Sex and the City 2. Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda - women who, for a certain kind of armchair fantasist, embodied all that was most glamorous and seductive about New York - have decamped to Abu Dhabi.\r\n\r\nIt’s only for a week, but it’s a good time for them to take stock of their lives.\r\n\r\nCarrie has finally snagged Big, but misses the excitement of evenings out on the town. Charlotte’s worried that husband Harry is smitten with the new and very bra-less nanny. Samantha’s overdoing pills and ointments to stave off the menopause. Miranda’s packed in her job because she can’t hear her own voice at work.\r\n\r\nIn short, they’re all getting older, and developing a new set of neuroses to cultivate between their continued shopping frenzies.\r\n\r\n\"Neuroses\" is a heavy way of putting it. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker, looking, if you happen to go for human pipe-cleaners, absolutely fabulous), frets: “I’ve been cheating on fashion with furniture.”\r\n\r\nShe may be an in-demand journalist whose bestselling books - the most recent one is entitled \"I Do. Do I?\" - tap into the secret chambers of every overachieving thirty- and fortysomething female heart, but she still finds it hard to understand why men sometimes prefer to stay at home watching black-and-white movies on TV rather than slurping cocktails at corporate parties. Because it’s, er, preferable?\r\n\r\nAnyway, off the girls trot, all-expenses-paid, on a mission of hope to the UAE.\r\n\r\nInspired by Barack Obama’s conciliatory overtures to the Islamic world, they’re planning to set up a policy institute that will help future East-West dialogues. Sorry, I meant planning to slurp cocktails, gawk at the packets of every himbo ex-pat they bump into, and coo over how cheap the shoes and beaded fabrics are at local souks.\r\n\r\nThe New Middle East! they holler. It’s very much like the old New York. Right down to Samantha (Kim Cattrall) getting into trouble for sucking at a hookah like it’s some guy she’s just pulled at a downtown bar.\r\n\r\nThe first Sex and the City film got a free pass from loyal viewers of the television series. This one will try their patience.\r\n\r\nThe clothes for one are mostly dreadful. Sarah Jessica Parker looks like a cross between Wurzel Gummidge and Bride of Chucky; Miranda looks badly embalmed. In one scene where the gang appears coming over a dune in the Arabian desert, they resemble a karaoke tribute act to the Village People.\r\nWorse, they don’t act like a gang, appearing as awkward and semi-detached in each other’s company as if they were attending a school reunion bash.\r\n\r\nIs it because they’re so much older and still carrying on like members of an Imelda Marcos-organised hen party? Or is it that we’re older, being asked by the government to tighten our belts and look askance at the spend-spend habits that got us into the current recession, to the extent that there seems something not so much escapist as straight-out vapid about Carrie and her pals?\r\n\r\nI hope Art Malik, Omid Djalili and all those other actors happy to add nu-Orientalist \"colour\" to this film got a tidy wage packet in return for their brownface turns.\r\n\r\nIt’s too easy to take pot shots at the film’s diagnosis of contemporary Middle Eastern affairs (basically: if only the sheikhs would let braying Upper East Siders hit on random dudes and let their local women show off the designer clothes they crave more than equality), but what’s really odd, given that writer-director Michael Patrick King is gay, is the strangeness of its opening scenes in which Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone) and Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson) get hitched.\r\n\r\nAt this none-more-campy wedding, Liza Minnelli performs a tush-shaking version of Beyonce’s Single Ladies, Big (Chris Noth) gets hit on by the first guy he meets, and all the sisters giggle about the \"Gay Wedding\" as if they’re boy-men from a Judd Apatow movie rather than long-term friends of the pair getting married.\r\n\r\nSex and the City 2 goes on for half a lifetime, brandishes enough product placements to embarrass a Formula One driver, and contains approximately three good one-liners (Samantha’s hope that a Danish architect could be the “Lawrence of my Labia” the best of them).\r\n\r\nI lost count of the number of times the filmmakers dropped the word “sparkle” into the script; no doubt they thought they were going for gold, but they’ve created a load of Ratners.", date_published: "May 25, 2010", year: 2010, writer_id: 2, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/sex-and-the-city-2.jpg").open, excerpt: "Sarah Jessica Parker looks like a cross between Wurzel Gummidge and Bride of Chucky; Miranda looks badly embalmed.", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/sex-and-the-city-2.jpg").open},
  {title: "Grace of Monaco", content: "It's traditional for Cannes to start with something spectacular. This is certainly no exception. It is a film so awe-inspiringly wooden that it is basically a fire-risk. The cringe-factor is ionospherically high. A fleet of ambulances may have to be stationed outside the Palais to take tuxed audiences to hospital afterwards to have their toes uncurled under general anesthetic.\r\n\r\nGrace of Monaco is a stately and swooning homage to Princess Grace, formerly Grace Kelly, focusing on her alleged courage in keeping plucky little Monaco safe for tax-avoiding billionaires. This was during its supremely parochial and uninteresting 1962 face-off with Charles De Gaulle, who wanted to absorb the principality and its monies into France's national bosom. So can Grace, by finally sacrificing her movie career on the altar of this cockamamie Ruritanian state, and flaunting her martyred couture loveliness, win the respect of the Monégasque folk and even the grumpy old Général himself?\r\n\r\nThe resulting film about this fantastically boring crisis is like a 104-minute Chanel ad, only without the subtlety and depth. Princess Grace herself is played by Nicole Kidman, wafting around the Palace with dewy-eyed features and slightly parted lips which make her look like a grown-up Bambi after a couple of cocktails, suddenly remembering his mother's violent death in the forest.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem that long since we endured a horrendous biopic of Princess Diana, that other super-rich blonde pasionaria — played by Naomi Watts. As audiences reeled into the foyer after that, they comforted themselves with the thought that surely things couldn't get worse. Surely they wouldn't be forced to endure another badly acted, badly directed film about a wealthy and self-pitying royal?\r\n\r\nHow very wrong. I can now actually imagine a creepy science-fiction short story about someone going back to prehistoric days in a time machine, killing a tiny trilobite, and then coming to the present to find everything the same, only now it's Naomi Watts playing Grace and Nicole Kidman playing Diana.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins with a sketch of jowly and adorable old Alfred Hitchcock (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) coming to Monaco hoping to tempt Grace back to the movies, proffering a juicy leading role in his latest film, Marnie. Two recent dramas about Hitchcock's troubled life — one for cinema, a better one for TV — have in fact begun in approximately the same way, but then followed the troubled director back to the US. Here, we stay with Kidman's Grace, who is effectively confronted by a dilemma. Should she return to her selfish, shallow life in Hollywood or build a new shallow, selfish life in Monte Carlo?\r\n\r\nAnd so the terrible mental turmoil begins. She pores over the script, late at night, in bed, with stylish reading glasses. During the day, she tries her darnedest to impress the wittering ladies of Monaco by entering into the spirit of charity galas and such. She worries about plotting against her at court. She consults her confidant, one Father Francis Tucker, a sorrowing priest who is evidently permitted the familiarity of calling her \"Gracie\", played with conviction by Frank Langella.\r\n\r\nThen, in order to bone up on the history and culture of Monaco — and perhaps because the situation is not yet sufficiently gay — Grace consults a local nobleman, Count Fernando D'Aillieres, played by Derek Jacobi. He scampers about the hillsides, with Grace in tow, filling her in on all the tiresome details, while also presuming to give her tips on acting and deportment. (Surely as an Oscar-winning star she knows this stuff already?) Jacobi has a little fun with the part, although it needed Ian McKellen to come on, playing the Count's ageing houseboy.\r\n\r\nBut how about the people for whom it is all supposed to be about? Her, erm, husband and children? Well, the absolute indifference shown by Grace to her kids here is startling. And what of Prince Rainier himself, that fairy-tale prince for whom she gave it all up? He is played by Tim Roth, who gives a very cigarette-smoking, glasses-wearing, moustache-having performance. He is always leaning in his chair, leaning against door frames — looking through his glasses, and smoking. What is this remarkable head of state thinking about? As performed by Tim Roth, it looks like he is thinking about how much he regrets taking this appalling role, and how inadequate he considers his fee, whatever it is.\r\n\r\nAn interesting, complex film could be made about a talented woman who decides to make the best of being trapped in an imperfect marriage. But such a film would have to stop curtsying, and really think about its subject.", date_published: "May 14, 2014", year: 2014, writer_id: 3, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/grace-of-monaco.jpg").open, excerpt: "It is a film so awe-inspiringly wooden that it is basically a fire-risk.", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/grace-of-monaco.jpg").open},
  {title: "White House Down", content: "Everyone in White House Down is an idiot, clinically insane, a cliche or a vehicle for shameless exploitation. Some characters go for the combo platter. For example, one guy’s an idiot AND insane.\r\n\r\nJust three months after the release of Olympus Has Fallen, with Gerard Butler as a former U.S. Army Ranger with a checkered past who must singlehandedly save the White House from a terrorist attack, we get Channing Tatum as a veteran with a checkered past who must singlehandedly . . . you know. Olympus Has Fallen was a decidedly mediocre film. And yet it’s The Manchurian Candidate meets the original Die Hard meets In the Line of Fire compared to this cartoonish, offensive, overblown, clanging, steaming piece of . . . cinema.\r\n\r\nLet’s see who’s all here. We’ve got Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer, the peace-loving, Jordan sneakers-wearing, Nicorette-chewing POTUS intent on withdrawing all troops from the Middle East, to the dismay of many special interests. (“You ever heard of the military-industrial complex?” he says at one point. No, never. Tell us more, Mr. President!)\r\n\r\nPOTUS always carries a gold pocket watch that Mary Todd Lincoln once gave to Abraham Lincoln to remind him he only had so much time to make a difference. We’re told this was a present from the first lady, who must have found it on e-Bay or something.\r\n\r\nChanning Tatum is Cale, a Capitol-area police officer who dreams of becoming Secret Service. Joey King is his 11-year-old daughter, Emily, a precocious political junkie who of course resents her father because he’s never around. He just missed the school talent show! Divorced dads in movies NEVER miss the school talent show!\r\n\r\nMaggie Gyllenhaal is Cale’s ex-hookup from college, now a top-level Secret Service agent. James Woods is the head of the president’s Secret Service detail, and we know what his deal is the minute we see him saying goodbye to his wife as he leaves for work. Jason Clarke is Hans Gruber — I’m sorry, Stenz, the baddest of the bad guys. Richard Jenkins is the Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\nIt's a crowded cast, and with a bloated running time of 137 minutes, there’s room for everyone in White House Down to spout unintentionally funny lines and generally embarrass himself. In the world of White House Down, it's comically easy for a band of domestic terrorists to take over the White House, repeatedly gunning down arguably the most inept Secret Service and military personnel ever seen on film.\r\n\r\nIn classic Die Hard fashion, our boy Cale just happens to be in the wrong place at the right time, and before you can say “yippie-ki-yay,” he’s in a sleeveless T-shirt and picking off the bad guys one by one, communicating with various folks on hand-held devices and of course desperately trying to save his daughter. (Saving her life will TOTALLY make up for missing that talent show.) And that poor kid. She witnesses multiple murders, as innocent people are shot at point-blank range. She gets slapped around and pushed around. She weeps while a bad guy holds a gun to her head. Yeah, that’s some PG-13 entertainment right there.\r\n\r\nEmily also performs some remarkable acts of bravery, including a YouTube moment that goes viral and results in some portrayals of modern media news coverage so off-key you’d think someone from another planet was the film’s screenwriter. She also participates in a scene designed to stir our emotions that will almost certainly elicit gales of laughter from audiences.\r\n\r\nI have seen more than 3,000 movies in the last 15 years, and the scene in question is so egregiously stupid, I’m still shaking my head days later. (Which looks really weird when I’m driving.)\r\n\r\nI know: White House Down isn’t supposed to be some gritty thriller. It’s just a big, loud, popcorn movie from Roland Emmerich, director of Independence Day, Godzilla, 10,000 B.C. and 2012, among other assaults on the senses. (OK, Independence Day was ridiculous good fun. Those other titles were just awful.) But Transformers 3 was subtle compared to this nonsense.\r\n\r\nEmmerich doesn’t flinch as he puts a child character in constant jeopardy, shamelessly borrows from better movies and constantly insults our intelligence with jingoistic manipulation and cheesy one-liners. Between scenes of escalating violence and carnage in and around the White House, we see good actors reciting bad dialogue with various degrees of enthusiasm. Tatum and Foxx seem to know they’re in a dopey buddy movie. Jenkins and Woods, among others, are saddled with the impossible task of making us believe they are serious, substantial people neck-deep in a pivotal moment in American history.\r\n\r\nNot since Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges in Airplane! have I seen a more impressive display of keeping a straight face.

  {title: "After Earth", content: "After starring in the sci-fi flick \"After Earth,\" Jaden Smith may want to rethink his future as an actor.\r\n\r\nBasically, this is Smith and his real-life son, Jaden (both affecting ridiculous mid-Atlantic accents) talking the audience to death for something like 90 minutes before the closing credits.\r\n\r\nI’m giving it one star because Smith’s longtime enablers at Sony apparently encouraged him to whittle this humorless sci-fi epic down from a much longer movie.\r\n\r\nThe back story in the opening narration — Earth’s evacuation following a vague environmental catastrophe — is boiled down to a couple of sentences.\r\n\r\nA thousand years later, Smith is the aptly named Cypher, a general in the United Ranger Corps, the military arm of the former Earthlings who have settled on a distant planet and produced exceedingly dull descendants.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of retirement, Cypher decides to take his 14-year-old son, Kitai, along on his last mission.\r\n\r\nThe two have a frosty relationship because, we’re told, Kitai blames his frequently absent dad for his sister’s death. I have a sneaking suspicion that the fact Cypher wears a perpetual scowl probably doesn’t help things.\r\n\r\nA meteor shower forces their spacecraft to crash land on Earth, where Cypher and son are the only survivors in a hostile environment. \"Do exactly as I tell you, and we will survive!\" the disabled Cypher barks at Kitai in an order that would probably sound better if papa Smith had delivered it as a rap lyric.\r\n\r\nMost of the film consists of Kitai traveling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon, and then, even less interestingly, trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal.\r\n\r\nThere are exactly two action sequences — brief pursuit by what look like deranged orangutans, and a climactic battle with a badly executed special effect that’s supposed to represent a deadly extraterrestrial.\r\n\r\nEleven years and several progressively more dreadful movies after \"Signs,\" director M. Night Shyamalan would be lucky to get a gig directing traffic.\r\n\r\nHis work on this reported $150 million vanity project manages to generate no suspense or excitement. Only yawns.\r\n\r\nWill Smith, who co-produced with assorted family members, also contributed the vaguely L. Ron Hubbard-ish story, for what is laughably described in the press notes as a \"franchise.\"\r\n\r\nThe erstwhile box-office king, who appears to be suffering from delusions of grandeur in recent years, really should stick to his day job.\r\n\r\nSeparating father and son for most of the film certainly limits the dramatic possibilities. What’s more, while Jaden Smith pulled off the remake of \"The Karate Kid,\" he’s not quite a good enough actor (or sufficiently charismatic) to hold the screen by himself in scene after scene.\r\n\r\nWe’re left to ponder how Earth remains so green and leafy when the temperatures drop below freezing every night, or why all that plant life can’t supply sufficient oxygen so that Kitai doesn’t have to rely on an imperiled supply of inhalers.\r\n\r\nHe is able to receive Dad’s overbearing self-help lectures via a communication device — which, like all the 31st-century technology on view, is surprisingly more fragile than anything you could buy at the Apple store these days.\r\n\r\n\"Fear is not real, it is a production of your imagination!\" Cypher exhorts Kitai. \"Danger is very real but fear is a choice!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so is avoiding the crashing bore that is \"After Earth.\"", date_published: "May 30, 2013", year: 2013, writer_id: 5, image: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/posters/after-earth.jpg").open, excerpt: "After starring in the sci-fi flick 'After Earth,' Jaden Smith may want to rethink his future as an actor", banner: Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/banners/after-earth.jpg").open}
